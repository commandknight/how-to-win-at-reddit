I stalled for about a week when I decided to take a week off to give my body some rest. The first day back in the gym I broke all my plateaus but since then (about two weeks now) I have been pretty stuck on several of my lifts. I eat in caloric surplus and make sure I have ate carbs and protein around 30 minutes before I go to the gym. Is there anything I can do to stop my frequent stalls and excessive tiredness in the gym?

I have some money saved up so I am hoping to live in a place that has some culture, liveliness and weirdness. Is anywhere near that area that is kinda eclectic? Cool breweries, farmers markets, restaurants, coffee shops or music venues? If not, where is the closest area that has a vibrant culture? I am not familiar with the area at all, so I thought I would ask y'all for help. Also, I do have a car. Thanks! \n\nEdit: Really appreciate all the replies. Although it sounds like Ashburn is kinda a bummer. Thanks to this info I am thinking of either moving in towards Reston or Wolf Trap (how are these areas?) or moving to Leesburg. Leesburg doesn't look too bad from some of the research I have done. I am moving with my girlfriend and our budget is about 2000$ a month for housing, although it seems like that may not get us as far as it did in Austin. Are the toll roads pretty pricy?

They also came out with a [podcast](http://www.cracked.com/podcast/the-horrible-90s-hit-song-that-explains-modern-world/) on the same topic. The latter page gives a decent summary of the basic premise:\n\n> In his new column going up tomorrow, David Wong uses the hilariously outdated Billy Joel song 'We Didn't Start The Fire' to illustrate a confounding problem with dominant white and western culture. The song chronologically lists everything that's gone wrong in the world from 1949 to 1989 in between choruses of \"We didn't start the fire,\" meaning, \"Hey, it's not my fault that the world is so fucked up.\"\n\n> It's a common and understandable knee-jerk reaction for people in the 21st century to think that just because they were born in the 1980s, or that their grandparents didn't come to America until the 20th century, that they're not responsible for something like slavery. Yes, it's true that you're not individually to blame for slavery, but you still may reap countless invisible benefits from being a white male in the 21st century that you just don't get if you're African-American, or from a poor family, or a woman. There's an endless context to complicated social matters that doesn't just begin or end with, \"I didn't start the fire.\"\n\n> That was just one example of the ways in which many people are blind to the historical context in which we live-that every moment in the present is either consciously or subconsciously tied to the entire history of our species. This week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by David Wong (aka Jason Pargin) and Josh Sargent to discuss these historical blindspots and how they're being slowly eroded by the human progress of the last two centuries.\n\nAnyway, the article has been making the rounds lately:\n\n[Here is a discussion of the article](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/36hij4/socjus_read_this_cracked_literally_just_spelled/) on /r/KotakuInAction. \n\n[Here's the reaction to KiA's discussion](http://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/37f2qs/cracked_publishes_an_article_about/)  on /r/GamerGhazi.\n\n[And here's a similar post](http://np.reddit.com/r/BestOfOutrageCulture/comments/37f2po/cracked_publishes_an_article_about/) on /r/BestOfOutrageCulture.\n\nWhat do you think of the article? Do you agree with the ideas presented by the author?\n\nWhat do you think of the reaction that pro- and anti-GGers (represented by KiA and by Ghazi/BoOC respectively) had towards the article? What does that say about the two sides and their political outlooks or historical worldviews?

As we all go to different colleges, we mainly used to talk via text or facebook messages, never by talking telephone. I would hang out with them individually at least once every fortnight. They were both friends with me but not friends with each other\n\nTo give a little background as to why I suddenly cut contact:\nI have always felt awkward when hanging out with friends, so I always just mirrored their personalities and to be honest after a while it gets boring pretending to be someone else. Also, we always hung out when it suited them and that annoyed me. I felt like I was always listening to their problems and to what they had to say but I could really add anything else to the friendship aside from just being a listener. I felt like I couldn't open up to them. So yeah, I just cut off contact one day. Childish, yeah I know.\n\nNow this may sound a little conceited (idk it's the best way to describe it) of me but at the time I thought to myself, \"these jerks don't really care about me, if they really wanted to hang out they'll contact me first, but the probably won't\"\nAnd well since then neither them nor me have messaged each other or hung out.\n\nBut recently I have started to change myself and now I'm a little more positive, I feel like I need to move on from the person I once was but at the same time I feel like I shouldn't really be a coward and forget the friends I used to have\n\nMy question is: should I just send a facebook or text message explaining why I cut off contact and that I apologize for not considering their feelings or should I just do nothing. Maybe they have already moved on\n\ntl;dr: I cut off contact with all my friends, not really looking to rekindle these friendships but wanna know if I should at least contact them to explain my actions\n\nThanks for reading, any advice or ideas is much appreciated", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn"}, {"score": 1, "url": "http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/27/8672293/better-apps-for-the-apple-watch-wont-be-here-until-this-fall", "id": "t3_37hirk", "author": "I_thght_he_was_wth_u", "title": "Better apps for the Apple Watch won't be here until this fall", "timecreated": 1432749538.0, "subreddit": "Techfeed", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_31zoq"}, {"score": 280, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/2t4Z3Dv.png", "id": "t3_37fiaj", "author": "lenskip", "title": "don't know if anyone knows this, but best thing so far", "timecreated": 1432708419.0, "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60"}, {"score": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Arkansas/comments/37hhsz/seeking_advice_for_arkansas_visit/", "id": "t3_37hhsz", "author": "FaceInABucket", "title": "Seeking advice for Arkansas visit.", "timecreated": 1432749137.0, "subreddit": "Arkansas", "selftext": "[removed]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo0w"}, {"score": 50, "url": "http://personacentral.com/chie-satonaka-p4ga-prize-figure-revealed/", "id": "t3_37hh3k", "author": "FluxWaveZ", "title": "Chie Satonaka P4GA Prize Figure Revealed", "timecreated": 1432748804.0, "subreddit": "Megaten", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sj8i"}, {"score": 831, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37gbes/what_is_something_meant_for_kids_that_you_still/", "id": "t3_37gbes", "author": "fuckswithducks", "title": "What is something meant for kids that you still enjoy as an adult?", "timecreated": 1432730078.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dotamasterrace/comments/37hggn/hots_is_not_that_bad_of_a_game/", "id": "t3_37hggn", "author": "JimTigerMan", "title": "Hots is not that bad of a game", "timecreated": 1432748512.0, "subreddit": "dotamasterrace", "selftext": "Guys,don't just jump on the bandwagon about HoTS.

For those who don't remember, Chafee was a Republican senator from Rhode Island back in 2002, and he was the only member of that party to vote NO on the AUMF in 2002.  Along with (I) Jim Jeffords & Chafee,  21 Democrats voted against giving Bush & Cheney the go-ahead on Iraq.  Had the other 29 Dems, including NY Sen. Hillary Clinton voted no, it would have been 52-48 against. I hold her and the other 28 Dems as accountable for the disaster that is Iraq as I hold GW, Cheney & the 2002 Senate GOP.\n\nNot that I think Lincoln Chafee has a prayer against the tidal wave of Clinton campaign $, but I look forward to hearing him debate her on *her* vote.\n\nWhich brings me back to the GOP roster of clowns currently campaigning for the nomination.\n\nIf history teaches us anything, it's that general elections are won in the middle.

Not conservative enough for the hard right wing, but more able to at least try to court the indies, conservative Dems, and the less extreme members of the party, who may have felt that Obama was moderate enough for their tastes.\n\nI'd be perfectly happy to vote for a Republican next year, so long as that person isn't a raging loon. But I can't find one in the field. \n\nWho, among the current GOP candidates, can be called moderate?\n\nCruz? Huckabee? Walker? Paul? Carson? Fiorina? Graham? Jindal? Perry? Rubio? Santorum? Christie? Trump? \n\nAnother Bush?\n\nNo,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no, & no.\n\nNot one of these people will pull significant votes from the middle, which is to say enough votes to defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election.\n\nConsidering the shifting demographics in the US, and the GOP's failure to adjust its platform and enlarge its tent, I'm starting to wonder if a Republican will ever live in the White House again.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf"}, {"score": 11, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/37gdud/the_biggest_decision_many_of_us_will_have_to_make/", "id": "t3_37gdud", "author": "Mythgraven", "title": "The Biggest Decision many of us will have to make before Heavensward...", "timecreated": 1432731398.0, "subreddit": "ffxiv", "selftext": "* Do we take time off from work at launch and risk the servers being a nightmare?\n\n* Or do we wait till things have calmed down then take our time off?\n\nQuite the dilemma indeed.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7"}, {"score": 15, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sidehugs/comments/37h99h/my_parents_think_im_an_atheist_because_i_dont/", "id": "t3_37h99h", "author": "TheTedinator", "title": "My parents think I'm an Atheist because I don't believe in God!", "timecreated": 1432745728.0, "subreddit": "Sidehugs", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tjsn"}, {"score": 4222, "url": "http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/05/19/bernie-sanders-on-clinton.cnn", "id": "t3_37en6t", "author": "JackKieser", "title": "Bernie Sanders: \"Today, I just introduced legislation that would make public colleges and universities tuition free.\" (2:29)", "timecreated": 1432691528.0, "subreddit": "politics", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq"}, {"score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/37hikr/looking_for_an_anime_with_outstanding_animation/", "id": "t3_37hikr", "author": "ProffessorOak", "title": "Looking for an anime with outstanding animation or animation that impressed you", "timecreated": 1432749465.0, "subreddit": "Animesuggest", "selftext": "Just list anything you feel has great animation that really stands out or that you were personally impressed by.

I'll add the scores here as they release.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah and if people can post links to reviews in case I miss them that'd be awesome\n\n[Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii-u/splatoon): 81/100\n\n[IGN (review in progress)](http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review?utm_campaign=ign+main+twitter&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social): 7.9/10\n\n> Nintendo\u2019s take on the third-person shooter is refreshingly original, with lots of impressive tools and skillful mobility. Matches are consistently fun and tense, and the mechanics feel simple enough that almost anyone can contribute positively. Splatoon really needs the extra modes and content Nintendo says is coming once a portion of the community levels up a bit, and not having voice chat is a bummer, but what is here feels polished and kept me claiming turf for hours.\n\n[Gamespot (review in progress)](http://www.gamespot.com/splatoon-review/):\n\n> I've been playing Splatoon, Nintendo\u2019s new and unusual shooter, for just over a week, and my experience has ranged from delightful to frustrating. Its inventive mechanics are refreshing, making it easy to enjoy both the single player and multiplayer components.\n\n[Destructiod](http://www.destructoid.com/review-splatoon-291959.phtml): 8.5/10\n\n> In some ways, Splatoon's online component is disappointing, and the lack of so many features will likely push other shooter fans away. But most of those shortcomings can be forgiven in my mind because of how damn fun it is. As a shooter it's refreshing, and as a 3D platformer it's up there with some of Nintendo's greatest creations. You'll quickly forget about the fact that you're playing Turf War over and over as you squid down an alley, leap across a gap, and shoot enemies in the air as you fall. All Nintendo needs to do is keep supporting Splatoon, because the foundation is fantastic.\n\n[Polygon (provisional review)](http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/27/8588969/splatoon-review-nintendo-wii-u): 8.5/10\n\n> As of launch, though, Splatoon has enough going for it between the single-player and multiplayer to keep me happy. Nintendo has built two separate gameplay tracks that use the same mechanic yet feel discrete. They\u2019re both a ton of fun, and they both have some obvious areas ripe for improvement. I can\u2019t say whether Splatoon will become the next big franchise for Nintendo, with sequels every generation and spin-offs and endless fanboy buzz. But after this strong debut, it certainly deserves some attention.\n\n[The Jimquisition](http://www.thejimquisition.com/2015/05/splatoon-review-youre-a-squid-now/): 8/10\n\n> Splatoon may not offer much \u201ccontent\u201d out of the box, but it does offer enough reason to keep coming back to it, hungry for more. Despite a simple idea and a handful of maps, this eccentric shooter does \u2013 as the game\u2019s irritating in-universe TV hosts declare \u2013 \u201cstay fresh.\u201d It balances strategy with anarchy in a riveting way, and nails the balance between instant gratification and heartbreak as players obsessively cover their world with color and have to watch as their hard work is consistently overwritten in a way that only makes one more desperate to hit back. Some of the technical aspects of online multiplayer could use an overhaul, particularly the lobbies, but otherwise it\u2019s a smooth ride and a ton of energetic merriment.\n\n[The Escapist](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/13978-Splatoon-Review-Wii-U-s-Kid-Family-Friendly-Shooter): 4.5/5\n\n> Bottom Line: It shouldn't be as good as it is... but who am I to deny something this inkredible?\n\n>Recommendation: Adding another casually enjoyable multiplayer game to your Wii U's lineup will serve you well, but try before you buy if you're only interested in singleplayer.\n\n[GamesRadar](http://www.gamesradar.com/splatoon-review/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=gamesradar-owned&hootPostID=d3f603c2d105c032147bcecdc1f22b87): 3.5/5\n\n> It breaks my squid-loving heart to be so down on Splatoon, because the core gameplay offered is one of the freshest and most exciting things to come out of Nintendo in years. But I can't help but feel like this game should have come out three, maybe six months later, when all of the content is finished and included on the disc. As it stands, there's simply not enough game here on day one to make Splatoon anything more than a weekend curiosity, and there's no telling whether the content coming down the pipeline will be worth sticking around for.\n\n[TIME](http://time.com/3896082/splatoon-review/): 5/5\n\n> [battle dojo thoughts]...But those activities feel like distractions from Splatoon\u2018s triumphant team-play mode, the game\u2019s heart and soul, and the reason a guy like me, no fan of competitive online shooters, can\u2019t stop playing the darned thing. There\u2019s nothing else quite like it, nor the cathartic dopamine jolt to be had when you squid-skim up a paint-smeared quarter pipe, an Inkzooka at the ready, leap over the edge, take aim with your weapon, and reduce a startled opponent to goo.\n\n[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/22/splatoon-wii-u-review):\n\n>From the basic premise, Splatoon conjures dozens of fresh ideas, combining moving platforms, grids you can slip through, and exploding paint-filled objects. Beautiful and wildly addictive, this joins Mario Kart as one of the finest multiplayer games available.\n\n[Nintendo Life](http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu/splatoon): 9/10\n\n> In a sea of rock-solid single-player Nintendo experiences Splatoon is a standout as being an utterly sublime multiplayer endeavour. Everything is knitted beautifully and seamlessly together to create what is quite simply some of the most fun you can have online. Having been built specifically for online play it'll face the challenge of avoiding too many hiccups, but conceptually proves that the Big N is capable of keeping up-to-date with this particular modern gaming trend. The single player elements and the local multiplayer also present a way to enjoy the game when you're not geared up for the chaos that comes from fighting others online, and provide a useful reprieve if your internet cuts out.\n\n[Nintendo Feed](http://www.nintendofeed.com/2015/05/review-splatoon-wii-u.html): 9/10\n\n> In conclusion, Splatoon as a concept is without a doubt, a triumph. Coming from a company that we've seen happily pump more of the same for so many years, Splatoon is beyond refreshing and paves the way for Nintendo in an ever-changing industry. That being said, Splatoon does feel let down by really not being complete and what some would call lazy corner cutting. Like a great wine or cheese, Splatoon really needs to be left to mature with age\n\n[Attack of the Fanboy](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/splatoon-review/): 4.5/5 Loved It\n\n> Splatoon had a lot of expectations to live up to after its fantastic initial unveiling at E3 2014. It faltered in just a few places, such as the lack of voice chat, but overall it is another great new IP from Nintendo. The gameplay offers a fun new take on the genre, and presents a unique and enjoyable world. The visuals are stellar, and the soundtrack is very entertaining. The biggest star though is just the overall style of the game, with characters that will quickly endear themselves to every player. Splatoon is easily one of the most unique games of this generation, and one of the best as well.\n\n[GameXplain Video Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySToF3AZSEI): Loved it\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp"}, {"score": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/37fohm/tech_help_watchdogs_missing_audio_please_help/", "id": "t3_37fohm", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "[TECH HELP] Watchdogs missing audio please help!", "timecreated": 1432713376.0, "subreddit": "PS3", "selftext": "[deleted]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhw"}, {"score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/37hipk/skins_cases_and_trade_contracts_are_they_worth_it/", "id": "t3_37hipk", "author": "Goggi-Bice", "title": "Skins, Cases and Trade Contracts | Are they worth it ?", "timecreated": 1432749519.0, "subreddit": "GlobalOffensive", "selftext": "Hey guys!\nSo after the BIG update today (atleast here in germany) im wondering if all the money for Skins, Cases and Trade Contracts are really worth it.\n\nIf got lucky 2 days ago and got a Hyper Beast MW after 5-6 Cases and sold it for 80\u20ac (got 69,50\u20ac \u00b4cause of Steam) and bought a few Skins i wanted (AWP-Worm God FN stattrak | AK Wasteland | M4-A4 Dragon King Stattrak and a few more, less pricy ones).\nAll in all around 70\u20ac total worth of skins.\n\nSo and then out of nowhere (at least for me) there comes the update and suddenly my skins droped from being worth 70\u20ac to +/- 50\u20ac.

Once again this is not the only way, just one way to make this fight trivial. Most beneficial for pick up teams who are not use to running it together and desperately don't want to let go of the cp. Brief note, I highly recommend trying to do this \"legit\" or not ignore the mechanics as it can actually be very fun.  \n\nMy recommendations: \n\n- Defender Titan Running WOL and Illuminated. HOS14 recommended. Not blind Shanks are OP. \n\n- Everyone Running High (enough) impact 365 Arc Sniper Rifle (P&t, ESpear, LDR5001) Field scout and last round is gold. There are other snipers as well but i'd suggest the impact should not be any lower then P&T. \n\nOn another note since it is arc burn you will probably need to be lv 34 but a skilled 33 will do, just watch out as the arc damage from fallen enemies would obliterate you much quicker. \n\nStrategy: Have your group Kill the left side servitor, just make sure not to kill it until everyone is in position. There's a number of ways of going about this but we had the bubble around the location of where you find the servitor just before he goes up the stairs. The reasoning simple, we wanted the bubble in an open area where we can divide ourselves in the bubble to have a clear shot at skolas without having to worry about people getting in our way. For ex, one person left of the bubble popping in an out, one on the right and one in front mid. Bubble placement is key, as this location will also help blind the shanks right at the very end where time becomes critical. \n\nFrom there firing sniper shots while popping in and out of the bubble to reload, and you should be able to burn skolas very quickly. High impact snipers will stun lock him and he usually will only fire 1 shot every few seconds in between getting stunned if everyone is shooting him. If everything goes correctly, you will run out of bullets with him around 20% health or so, to which 2 people use synths to continually burn him while one person goes after the objective marker. \n\nTo reiterate we did not use a single rocket, in fact we only used primaries to burn the servitor in addition to firing sniper rounds. \n\nThe designated runner needs to make a judgement of when they should depart towards the objective depending on far it is. If its all the way to the other side of the map be sure to leave with more than 20 sec left to capture it in time. A blade dancer hunter is beneficial here. \n\nSkolas has been very generous with his drops this week, I am sorry if this strat does not work for you. \n\nVideo demonstrating this method - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVaNK72Qat4 \n\nObviously we were fortunate of the location of the first capture point, so we definitely had more room for error. \n\nEdits: To be more specific, HOS14 will also serve as a blinding source to the initial wave of shanks that appear from behind you. They usually spawn towards the end so be prepared and take advantage of things like super and nades to clear them if needed. \n\nMy LDR was hitting for nearly 9000 for precision shots and about 3500 to the body and many people are having trouble getting numbers close to that. I cannot stress how important both a maxed decent impact arc sniper is and the perk illuminated as that increase the benefits of weapons of light. My recommended perks personally are final round and field scout. I usually monitor when he fires at me hence I don't need unflinching but definitely not a bad perk otherwise especially running without a titan.  \n\n21/28 shots were precision hits including a few shots which landed bonus dmg as a result of final round. It is critical you take your time to hit those as you have very little margin of error. \n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w"}, {"score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37hjns/me_17_m_with_my_girlfriend_16_f_of_10_months_just/", "id": "t3_37hjns", "author": "throwaway799126", "title": "Me [17 M] with my Girlfriend [16 F] of 10 months, just graduated high school and I am having second thoughts.", "timecreated": 1432749889.0, "subreddit": "relationships", "selftext": "My girlfriend and I met 11 months ago through social media, and I am not ashamed to say that. We began actually \"talking\" about 2 weeks before our school year started, my senior year and her junior year. She was finishing up band camp at our high school, and I happen to be a five minute walk away. Every day they would get a break for lunch and dinner, and I would come visit her every time for the next couple weeks. Over those two weeks is when I fell in love with her, and after endless sweet texts exchanged between each other, I gathered up the courage to ask her out the next day.\n\nI never really knew what it felt like to actually love somebody until I met her. We are the best of friends, and practically the same person. We both have dark brown hair, and bushy eyebrows. She has dark brown eyes that sparkle more than any other eyes I have ever seen. Throughout our first seven months being together, she treated me better than I could've ever asked, and I did the same to her.\n\nDaily short love notes fluttered our locker we shared, and kisses and hugs ended our time together between classes. Fights happened frequently, as you can expect from a \"silly high school relationship\". But we worked them out better than I ever had before with anyone else. (I had only two other girlfriends previously, one in tenth grade and one in ninth.) Sometimes it felt like we were a married couple, the way we fought and the way we thought the same.\n\nThroughout our relationship we have skyped a total of almost 600 hours (yes, all night almost every night, chargers plugged in;RIP our phone battery efficiency) and spent around 90% of the past 10 months days together. However she still thinks my hobby (computer hardware and computer video games) take up too much of my time. I plan on going to college and getting my masters degree in computer science. I am on the brink of adult life and she is still stuck in high school for 2 more years. I feel as if the amount of time I will spend at my job/college will be too much for us to last, and the time I am spending with her now is wasted time for us both. I want to continue to pursue my interest in my one and only hobby, which is computers. However I feel as if her frequent nagging about me spending money on computer parts instead of her will make me quit, and I dont want to quit.\n\nI don't know a good way to summarize this thread, and this was probably the worst written thread you will ever read.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: I don't have a question, I am just asking for advice.

Apparently a developer confirmed that it was, thank goodness, just a mistake. I'm glad this reddit thread got enough attention that a valve employee actually responded to the issue. Thanks, /r/GlobalOffensive \n\nYesterday's update disabled random skin drops on community servers. This comes on the back of an update from *months* ago that disables being able to join off friends if friends are in community servers. This comes on the back of update after update that breaks how Sourcemod and Metamod communicate with the game (all those awesome features you love about community servers are only made possible with Sourcemod and Metamod). (Just a little history - CSGO developers used to communicate with the developers of Sourcemod and Metamod and let them know what kinds of updates they were about to push to give SM and MM a chance to update - this no longer happens.)\n\nAnybody who has played CS longer than CSGO knows that the community is the reason the games have flourished. This is the first CS game with official valve servers. Many of the features in this version of CS were remakes of very popular community mods.\n\nI have been running CS servers since 2007. I have run servers in 1.6, CZ, Source, and GO, as well as TF2, DoD:S, L4D, and others. I made my first CSGO server on day one of beta testing community servers. I enjoy the cohesive community that builds up around a well-run community server, a community of like-minded individuals who appreciate the type of atmosphere that can only be found in a community server.\n\nIf you're reading this thread, you enjoy that, too.\n\nBefore the ArmsDeal update, people would come into my server and ask a variety of questions - how do I set my rates for 128 tick? Do you have a deathmatch server? How can I donate? After the ArmsDeal update, people ask me one question - can I get drops on your server? I'm not mad about that - I buy a lot of stuff in steam because of the drops I get; I understand why people like drops. That's not the issue. The issue is that I have around 12 high traffic servers, regularly filled with people whose names I recognize instantly because of how frequently they are on, full of people who regularly tell me \"Your server is the best X server I have ever played on\" or \"I'm so glad somebody made a server like Y finally\", - (I say not to brag, but to underscore the fact that I am not a small time server owner hosting a server from my basement for me and my three friends) - and every single one of them has been empty since the update yesterday. The issue is that browsing my favorites list in the server browser, which used to have around 50 very popular community servers now has one (*one*) server with people in it. The issue is that the disability of drops on community has very quickly cleared them out.\n\nThe issue is that on the back of everything else Valve has done to hurt the community server community, they have now disabled drops on community servers.\n\nYes, there are people who don't care about skins, but they are unfortunately a small minority. The mere fact that you can sell your drops to buy other steam games makes the number of people who don't care about skins very low. Even if these people still *want* to play in community servers, they will probably find the numbers too low to try.\n\nI'm still not sure if this is a bug or a feature, because unfortunately, Valve developers have stopped replying on their mailing list dedicated to server operators. What was once a healthy dialog between server operators and valve developers has gone completely silent for months.\n\nWhat I am asking is for anybody who enjoys playing in community servers and doesn't want to see them gone, please make your voices heard. Reply with a statement of your love of community servers. Hopefully the thread will have enough attention that Valve will respond, since they seem more likely to respond on reddit than on their mailing list. I just want to know if this is a bug, and if it's not a bug, I want the community to beg valve to revert it.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sqho"}, {"score": 10, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/37fsv1/well_i_guess_no_wedding_cake_then/", "id": "t3_37h0ee", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "We made it to the frontpage again", "timecreated": 1432742052.0, "subreddit": "Turkey", "selftext": "[deleted]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlnu"}, {"score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/battleparty/comments/37f212/well_this_is_a_first/", "id": "t3_37f212", "author": "sl600rt", "title": "Well this is a @#$@#$^@ first.", "timecreated": 1432698663.0, "subreddit": "battleparty", "selftext": "Me, another champion and two lane minions in a tower's range.

I've been training for a little under 2 years, but 3 weeks ago someone quarter guarded me hard while drilling (I consider this a douchebag move but whatever, what the hell do I know I'm a white belt) and as I tried to cross knee pass my knee popped 4 times...\n\nKnee is still in pain and MRI will come next week, Doctor said recovery form a partial tear is between 9 to 12 months, in that time all my partners will be blue, all my technique will be gone and I'll have to start again ... just knowing how much it sucked and knowing any wrong move will set me back into starting again...\n\nI had barely started to enjoy and feel the flow, it really gets me down because it is really starting back up again is not like I was a blue belt or a purple belt .. no no .. just a plain white belt ... honestly is very discouraging and I'm actually amazed how even if I think \"nah it'll be fine\" i have this underlying feeling of \"fuck this, you'll suck more than anyone again than anyone that even joins the gym while you are there at home with your peg leg waiting patiently 'cause you noobed and got hurt while a white belt.\"\n\nIdeas? should I just STFU and train? (in a year I guess?) even flames are welcome]\n\nEDIT: It was not the position, I'm fine with quarter guard, it was clamping down 100% while drilling, I was counting on him to let me work just as I was letting him work, we were not even rolling, just drilling cross knee guard pass.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn02"}, {"score": 11, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/35a9te/bff_claims_i_am_legend_is_the_same_as_the_movie/", "id": "t3_35a9te", "author": "prepsi", "title": "BFF claims \"I Am Legend\" is the same as the movie???", "timecreated": 1431089101.0, "subreddit": "books", "selftext": "Dear /r/books,\n\nA few days ago I received an email notification that my BFF just finished reading *I Am Legend*.

What does everyone use when in a Melee combat fight? 1st Person View or 3rd Person View?  I find the first person view is stupidly hard to judge the distance of the weapons and where the player is when fighting in melee.  The only advantage is it is a little easier to get head shots with it.  \n\n2.)  When fighting melee in 3rd person where do you aim to get the most efficient number of hits to the head.  I find the heads hit box is in a weird spot or seems to shift around when your in 3rd person, or maybe it just my experience, however I wouldn't mind finding a better more consistent way of achieving this as I prefer 3rd person.\n\n3.)  Range weapons aka Bows / Xbows.  When using these weapons I find when shooting in 3rd person the accracy is all over the place until you get within a decent distance(maybe 3-4 iron pikes worth of distance)  Anything further its just RNG if it lands where you where you are aiming.  However in first person I can consistently put the arrow where I want at a MUCH greater distance, weather standing still or while moving.  I know its not a huge issue to switch between first and 3rd while using ranged weapons but I was just wondering if people found a nitch in 3rd person view while using bows on how to be more accurate at slightly longer distances so you don't have to switch views.\n\n4.)  When running from a fight is there no real way to not get your legs buggered by javelins or arrows?  Most of the time when i get swarmed by 2+ players, there is no escape as once they get 2 lucky jav hits my legs and crippled and its game over.  Just curious, don't have an issue with it just was wondering if I was missing anything.  \n\n5.)  Getting back to the head shot disucssion, when you do land a head shot is there any way to tell or not.  While testing with a friend the only real way I could tell was he was on team speak and told me it was a head shot.  Is there any graphical thing showing this other then beheading a guy if you have a 2h great sword vs someone without a helm?\n\nLet me know,\n\nThanks\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_37ast"}, {"score": 41, "url": "https://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/comment/2503959#Comment_2503959", "id": "t3_35a7qs", "author": "xLilBudz", "title": "Dr.Doom Release Aiming To Be June 4th, On 2 Year Anniversary", "timecreated": 1431087693.0, "subreddit": "marvelheroes", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uhpg"}, {"score": 60, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/355nl5/i_feel_bad_for_pedophiles/", "id": "t3_355nl5", "author": "kobegriffeysanders", "title": "I feel bad for pedophiles.", "timecreated": 1430989082.0, "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "selftext": "...

As she's making her case for Westeros's worst parent Mel walks up and says \"Yeah but she's got Stannis's blood, oh and Stannis is a king, oh yeah and I almost burned a guy I knew had king's blood.\" Then last episode we get Stannis trying his hand at acting by saying he cares about his darling princess daughter.

Last Friday Lilith was acting strangely lethargic so they ran her up to the vet, she ended up staying there over the weekend and was constantly improving. Tuesday she was cleared to come home, she was doing really well - the vet was worried she was going to eat all of the food in the office. She made it back home, jumped up on the couch and immediately had a stroke which took her quickly. The vet thinks it was a blood clot. On top of all this, I'll be back in town *next week* for a visit. \n\nI've been going back and forth between denial and anger, but every time the anger comes back it seems to get worse. I'm fighting the urge to put my fist through walls as I walk by them. I'm furious that for all she knew, I vanished one day and never came back. I'm furious that she fought like hell to get over her illness just to be taken from us as soon as she was comfortable again. We've lost other pets before but I've never felt anger like this while I was grieving.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm posting this, but thank you all for letting me vent. \n\nRest in peace, sweet Lilith.

Is saying 3 when you have a 2.98 more or less acceptable than when you have a 2.90? \n* Are lies by omissions okay? For instance, applying to an internship that lists \"3.0 Required\" and applying when you have a 2.50 but never list your GPA.\n* Exaggerating a project that you may have worked on in the past\n* Flat out lying about GPA\n\nObviously, this will be a sensitive subject, so lets keep a calm discussion. Are there situations where you think it's okay to lie or fib?

After plenty of discussion regarding the morals of their supposed actions, it is brought to a vote on whether or not we should have a trial to remove them from the district, and the vote passes. However, since then, this post has been made: [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SouthShire/comments/370xat/ssf_temporarily_suspending_operations/). Presumably there will no longer be a trial out of this.\n\n2) Southshire is going to be hosting the X-District meeting next week on May 30th! While we have most of the hosting side of things finished up, we still need to think of a topic we can bring up and who will represent us at the meeting. Maky will be making a post on the subreddit later on asking for volunteers for representatives. As for a topic, it was decided we would bring up the potential for criminals to use the new trading cards to get away with crimes.\n\n3) An announcement! Bibliotaph has requested that anybody with Spyd related literature may donate the books to the Spyd Shrine/Embassy in Cloud Kingdom. You can drop of books to the mailbox at the Bibliboard at ~ 0,600.\n\n4) It is proposed that the council should appoint specific positions to people in the community, such as official judge, IA officer, ect. The council puts it to a vote and the motion doesn't pass.\n\n**Community Topics**\n\n1) ***WOW!***\n\n2) Should Tunts be allowed to adopt Cuecast? After discussion, it is decided due to the terms of him being under the jurisdiction of Cloud Kingdom, it won't be allowed.\n\n3) Can one person represent two districts as a super rep at the X-District? The council puts it to a vote and decides no, one person can not represent SouthShire anyways while also representing another district.\n\n4) An announcement I guess. Cloud Kingdom is in the talks of merging with the Slums and Paupers, and proposes SouthShire may do the same for 64 GD. Yeah.\n\nMeeting adjourned!

Now how does it work? Look below.\n\n**How to enter:**\n\n* Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate. \n\n**Important Rules:**\n\n* Only ONE top level (not a reply) comment per person, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments will result in exclusion from entering. Go to /u/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment. Delete any extra duplicates ASAP. \n\n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person. We also have an updated set of guidelines we are following to filter out cheaters, or old alts.\n\n\n\n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n\n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/millionairemakers/comments/2ournt/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n\n**Reminders**\n\n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin you can use [Circle](https://www.circle.com/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it. \n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers\"` or checkout our [IFTTT recipes](/r/jaysamuel/comments/2wnvrw/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes/). \n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between were we made it it in /r/all and donations. \n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.** \n\nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n\n**Advice:**\n\n* If the community doesn't like you, even if you win, nobody will donate. So don't be a jerk.\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n\nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n\nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n\nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

I am so proud of my father, so proud to be his son. This man wakes up at 5:30 am each day, writes, is on his third novel, then goes to work until about 8:00 pm, and hardly ever complains. What a man. \n\nIt took me time to reach this conclusion, it took me time because my mother always made sure to be the center of it all. She always compared herself by listing all the things she did the same day; I did this, I did that. Hell, she would tire from things that were about a quarter of what my dad would do in a day. \"Oh what a day I had\" she says, as she sits in front of the T.V. My fathers walks in, suited up, looking as fresh as when he left, comes to my mother, kisses her, hugs his children and goes about his evening. No complaint. No comparison.\n\nI'm disappointed in myself it took me so long to appreciate him like this, so long to see that I did have a role model in the house. My mother pointed the spotlight at herself so much, that the spotlight never reached my father at all. It didn't matter to him, but it matters to me.\n\nSo I ask fellow Red Pillers, are you proud of your father, if so, why?, if not, why not?. Feel free to vent.\n\nEdit: I would love to comment on all of your stories but unfortunately I have been banned from TheRedPill because of this post.\n\nConclusion: I have read through every single one of your stories and you've all made me quite emotional. There are men here who's fathers were a total mess and set them up for failure, while others have/had leading fathers who pushed them towards success. Both of which have taught you who to be or who not to be, you've changed your lives because of them and you are who you are today because of them, for good and for bad. I'm extremely happy that this thread blew up the way it has, while it's an emotional subject it's an important one. \n\n\"Just when the caterpillar thought the world was ending, he turned into a butterfly.\"", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u"}, {"score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/3713jf/why_are_so_many_people_against_rawternative/", "id": "t3_3713jf", "author": "The_Great_Mutox", "title": "Why are so many people against \"#RAWternative\"", "timecreated": 1432417863.0, "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "selftext": "Many people complain about how they don't enjoy the current product but yet once something free and easily accessible like RAWternative is brought up it's constantly shit on.

If honest criticism hurts, so be it. \nThe facts on the ground in the occupied territories paint a completely different story about who is being held to a special standard. Including an unending occupation, siege, and colonization, Israeli provocations occur daily.\n### Israel\u2019s different standard towards the Palestinians\nIsrael commits countless provocations without any serious Palestinian response, and gets away with it with total impunity. The Israelis do everything in the name of security meanwhile confiscating more land outside her borders, expanding settlements. \nFor example, The Al Mezan Center for Human Rights reported in the first ten days of May Israeli forces escalated their attacks on Palestinians in the Israeli-implemented \u201cbuffer zones\u201d or restricted areas. [According to Al Mezan\u2019s monitoring and documentation, during the aforementioned period Israeli forces opened fire in border areas on six occasions. The attacks resulted in injury to four people including one child. The Israeli forces arrested five people including two fishermen. In the ARA by sea, Israeli forces opened fire at Palestinian fishermen on ten occasions, resulting in injury to at least two people. The occupying forces also confiscated one fishing boat.] (http://www.mezan.org/en/post/20228/Israeli%20Forces%20Escalate%20Attacks%20in%20Access%20Restricted%20Areas%3Cbr%3EAl%20Mezan%20Condemns%20Attacks%20against%20Civilians%20and%20Calls%20on%20International%20Community%20to%20Provide%20Protection)\n\nWhy when the Israelis attack on civilians is it justified, but any Palestinian resistance is denounced as terror? \n\n### Only Jews have a right to security \nAnother interesting double standard was clearly exemplified in Isarel\u2019s unjust law enforcement in the West Bank. The Israeli Human Rights group Yesh-Din proved how Palestinians are *denied any right to security by Israel*. On their blog a post describing their report \u201cMock Enforcement\u201d, explains that [the chances of the police getting someone indicted as a result of a complaint by a Palestinian \u2013 that the police will both find the suspect and gather sufficient evidence against him \u2013 is only 7.4%. But even if the police succeeded in doing its job, and a suspect was indicted, the chances of a conviction would be slim. Ultimately, the chance that a complaint by a Palestinian victim to the police will result in a conviction is only 1.8%, i.e. a chance of less than 1:50.] (http://blog.yesh-din.org/en/?p=977)\n\n### The facts are clear\nThe facts are very clear. Israel is the aggressor and commits daily provocations despite no Palestinian attacks or reactions in most cases. Besides that she also denies Palestinians any right to security in the West Bank. Who must the Palestinians call when their lives are threatened by settlers if not the police? \nIsrael\u2019s actions are no more than extreme double standards. While she humiliates an entire people in the name of her security, consistently commits provocations, and then denies Palestinians their own right to security \u2013 it is obvious. Palestinian lives just don\u2019t matter to Israel. Israel couldn\u2019t be happier if Palestinians could just disappear one day. \n", "subreddit_id": "t5_37s00"}, {"score": 266, "url": "https://soundcloud.com/littleredhead54/dig-it-d-tent", "id": "t3_3702mq", "author": "THEMIGHTYWIK", "title": "With the release of 'Holes' (2003) a promotional song was released called: 'Dig it'.

I didn't want to be on vicodin or oxycodone anymore. I took pain meds  daily and developed a  habit . I wanted to stop the pain meds because I hated the way I felt mentally and physically... The problem was that I still had alot of pain so I decided to take kratom to deal with it. It was wonderful, and I took it for a good year. In this situation, I never took a break switching between the pain medication to kratom.. I just switched over and only took kratom.  \n\nEventually I decided I wanted to be off of everything for a while and see if I could deal with my pain without medication, and I decided I would quit taking kratom all together. I tapered at first, and it was not easy at all.. but I eventually managed to stop taking kratom. It was not impossible, but it was difficult. I was taking 10 Grams a day for a year, every day.  I had some restless legs and no sleep for a few nights. It wasn't fun at all. It was very hard, but not impossible.  Anyway I got through that and decided was done with kratom for a while. During a 6 month period I took nothing tried my best to deal with my pain on my own with hypnosis, meditation, yoga.. all that good stuff. \n\nUnfortunately the pain eventually took over no matter what I did, and I decided I would take kratom again because I really couldnt have a quality life in such agony and there was no way I was going to go back to pain meds.. \n\nIn time after almost a year of use...I noticed my tolerance was going up so I decided to quit .. again...\n\nI was dreading going through what I went through the first time, but I wanted to get it over with so I thought I would  try cold turkey --and if I couldn't handle it that way I would taper.. Again, I was taking about 10 grams daily at that time..   Surprisingly it wasn't bad at all.. One night of no sleep and I felt a little more tired than usual. maybe a little grumpy... but nothing too bad. I was able to go to work and do the usual.. I had a runny nose.. but that my friends was it!  I was so surprised ..  I will probably have to return to kratom again when I have terrible pain, and with taking breaks like this I hope for it to remain effective .. \n\nIn any case this personal experience got me to thinking.. why was it so difficult to quit the first time vs the second time?  It makes me wonder if having an opiate addiction then switching to kratom cause the withdrawals to be more difficult than someone who takes it without a previous opiate issue.  I had a good long break without anything in my system and took kratom again .. stopping this time was no problem at all.  \n\nMy instinct says that the reason why some people report such bad withdrawals is because something different happens with the kratom in an opiate addicted person .. vs someone who is not currently addicted to opiates and takes kratom. Perhaps that is why some report bad wds and some do not. \n\nI also think that taking extracts and more concentrated forms have the ability to create more difficult wds than just plain leaf. But that being said, I think through what I experienced the first time, being physically addicted to pain medication and switching over to kratom , that there may be a link why the wd's were so bad the first time over the second time ,in which I was not physically addicted to opiates. The second time was a breeze .. it seriously was.. \nJust a thought and thought I would share..", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qx0h"}, {"score": 2119, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/36yt0b/thanks_to_cd_projekt_red_and_the_witcher_3_for/", "id": "t3_36yt0b", "author": "guyaba", "title": "Thanks to CD Projekt Red and The Witcher 3 for the Best Gaming Experience I've Had Since I Was a Kid", "timecreated": 1432364639.0, "subreddit": "Games", "selftext": "Although the merits of the Witcher 3 have been mentioned many times, I'm so overcome by my love for this game and respect for the company that I have to type this out.\n\nAs a kid video games were magical, I could get lost in an RPG so easily; fall in love with the world and characters.

Both of the predecessors are already some of my favorite games so I was excited for the third installment but I was not ready for how amazing this game is.\n\nAt every turn I'm just impressed by something else. The love and care put into this game by CD Projekt Red is so evident, I haven't felt that respected and taken care of by a video game franchise ever before. I could go on and on about why it's so amazing, but I'll try to keep this to my very favorite things.\n\nAlthough I enjoy games like The Elder Scrolls and BioWare RPGs I always feel a disconnect between myself and the characters I play as. In those games my interactions with characters is always just trying to figure out how to trick the game into giving me the best outcome. When I play with a character as well written and well developed as Geralt I'm completely connected. I'm not just trying to get the best result from a conversation, I know no matter what choice I make I can't make Geralt act out of character. He's going to take the reward unless there's a damn good reason not to, and he's going to call that guy a dick if he's being a dick. I don't have to worry about defining him, and yet I still feel huge consequences from the choices I make. The other very impressive thing about the dialogue for me is that I am never fooled by an option. Anyone who has played RPGs in recent years has come across a time where they chose some innocuous looking dialogue option like \"let's go\" only to have your character slam his/her fist on the table and punch the princess in the face. Whenever I chose a dialogue option in the Witcher 3, Geralt acts exactly as I intended him to. Not only that but the writers are very aware of the motivations behind certain choices. Geralt will explain a choice that I've made and it has, so far, always been exactly why I made that choice.\n\nAside from the deep, rich world, the game is also beautiful. I often read the subtitles in games and skip the voice acting but I sit through everything in the Witcher 3. Every time I talk to someone it's like watching a scene in a movie and the voice acting is spectacular. I also enjoy how much the scenery in the game holds up across the entire series. I came across the little staircase to the sewers from a previous game and had an amazing moment of nostalgia. Here I am in a completely different game but I still feel like I know exactly where I am. This is something I never felt in the Mass Effect or Dragon Age series.\n\nAnd last but not least by any means the gameplay is just phenomenal. I feel like they looked at previous games and saw all the problems and gave us exactly what we wanted. The combat is so much more intuitive than it used to be and you're encouraged to use all aspects of the system. I never used very many signs (magic) in the previous games but I'm constantly using them now. The parrying also makes combat much more fun. Although I can run around like a mad man swinging my sword, the battle goes a lot better if I slow down and use my skills correctly. The quests in this game almost all feel well tough out, I don't have a constant stream of \"get 5 ghoul heart\" quests. Which leads me to another thing that is vastly improved in this game, crafting. When I started the Witcher 3 I spent at least an hour picking herbs off of all the farms thinking how I wold need a huge pile of them for potions later. That was never something I found fun in previous games but I knew I just had to deal with it. They now made the system a one time thing. Get the recipe, craft it and now you always have the potion as long as you have one item that refills every potion in your inventory.\n\nEvery complaint I could have made about a previous Witcher game game has been dealt with, and not just with a bandaid, with complete triple bypass surgery. And then on top of that they added so many new details that no one ever asked for but are so delightful, like watching Geralt's beard grow. And Gwent! It's the most fun I've had with a card game inside of a game since Triple Triad in FF8.\n\nI would keep writing more but I've probably reached the limit of anyone's attention, and I really need to get to sleep so I can wake up and play more. This might not be the most helpful post you'll read about The Witcher 3, I'm sure the game has faults that I just don't see, but this is my heartfelt thank you to CD Projekt Red for making the best, most magical, gaming experience I've had in years.\n\nThanks to anyone who read through this, now stop being on reddit and go play!\n\nEdit: I think a lot of people in the comments are hitting on the games minor flaws. I don't disagree with those flaws, but as a lot of people have said, they can point the flaws out and still love the game. The issues just don't take away from the amazing feeling I get while playing.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp"}, {"score": 8, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/370ua2/i_really_need_some_advice/", "id": "t3_370ua2", "author": "DigitalLemurs", "title": "I really need some advice.", "timecreated": 1432413072.0, "subreddit": "leaves", "selftext": "Hello r/leaves,\rI've been following this sub for a couple of months now as I've been attempting to quit using. I am a 19 year old male who started smoking at the age of 16.\r\rIt started out with smoking once every weekend, but complications with mental health lead to me smoking daily fairly quickly. For the past 2 1/2 years I have been smoking appox. 4 - 5 times per day to feel ok. Every attempt I have made to quit has failed.\r\rDuring year 2 of usage, I had a run in with the law and was forced to quit for a period of two months. Those were the worst two months of my life and as soon as I figured out the drug tests would never happen, I returned to smoking. Recently I have had another encounter with the police and am required to take mandatory drug tests on a weekly basis.\r\rAs such I have attempted to at the very least taper my usage over the past couple days. I was able to go almost 24 hours before I had what my dad tells me was an episode of dissociative amnesia. I have no recollection of this event.\rWhen I go without smoking, I get uncontrollable shaking and twitching of the neck and arms. Extreme mood swings occur and can range from smashing walls and cell phones, to hopelessness and desperation so real that I have attempted suicide on a few occasions. Thinking clearly or rationally becomes nearly impossible.\r\rI have never seen anyone describe symptoms near as severe as what I am going through and that really crushes my spirit. I don't know how this is even possible, its marijuana not heroin right? Or maybe its just that nobody talks about this side of the perfect plant..\r\rAlso I had been seeing a psychiatrist before I began smoking. As of today we have been through treatments and medications for bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety, add and multiple combinations of those. Nothing seems to help and the diagnoses keeps changing.\r\rI'm looking for any possible advice anyone has... I really don't want to end up in jail or dead..\r\rI am willing to fill in details and answer questions anyone may have.

At first it was really casual, which is how we both thought it would remain since I was a junior in college set to go abroad the next semester and she's a senior. However, we both fell for each other like we've never fallen for anyone else. We're both the first people we have ever loved, and I'm very certain of that on both ends. \n\nAnyway, even after last semester ended, I flew to visit her for New Year's, and then our relationship basically continued throughout my semester abroad, except it wasn't exclusive or official or commited or anything. We would just talk everyday, and it was very clear we both had deep feelings for each other. It just didn't seem like the situation was right for us to be exclusive, considering I'm studying abroad and she's a senior that just graduated from college. However, she came to visit me for her spring break instead of going to the typical college spring break situation, which meant  a lot to me. Over spring break, we had an amazing time and let it out that we were in love. She told me she was someone that she wanted to be with for the rest of her life, and she's never ever thought that about anyone.  It also turned out that we were going to be in the same place over the summer. I only had a month and a half abroad, and I just knew that I didn't want to be with anyone but her. I asked her to be my girlfriend, as in a commited/exclusive relatonship. She said yes. I'm her first exclusive boyfriend in college.\n\nFlashforward to 2 days ago, when she was at this block party for her graduation. It was a big party. She was texting me througout, and I could tell she was really really hammered from her texgs but I just didn't think much of it cause I wasn't about to limit her from having fun in her last few days of college. Suddenly, she didn't text me back for like an hour and a half. The next text I get from her is \"Baby we need to talk I fucked up, call me asap\" (and I had a missed call from her). I skype called her, and she told me she had gotten with someone. She said she was black out drunk. One moment she does remember  sitting with this guy outside of her house where the block party was (and there were other people around), and she does have some vague memory of him telling her she needed to get whatever inside, but her next memory is of her being upstairs in her room with the guy hooking up while she was blowing him. She said it ended shortly after she came back to (although she did finish blowing him....), and she has a hazy memory of her kicking him out. Then she started bawling in her room because she realized what she had done, and her roommates came in to consoler her. And that's when she called me. \n\nI believe her that she was as drunk as she says. I saw her with my own eyes, and she was about as drunk as someone can be while conscious. I obviously don't know the extent to which it actually occurred the way she said -- that she went from being outside one moment and the next they were together in her bed. She is very adamant that she doesn't remember how it actually happened. And also, she has taken responsibility for her actions regardless of her blackout.\n\nI'm just very torn about this. I feel like shit obviously. On the one hand, I've never loved a girl like this, and I do think she's being honest with me. I think I want to make this work, and I want to give her a second chance. The fact that she called me immediately after it happened says a lot about her. Before I even said anything, she offered up that she would do whatever she needed to assure me and win my trust my back. That she wasn't going to be drinking again until I felt comfortable with, and that it was nothing to her to give that up. She's also been miserable and lying in bed, telling me that she doesn't know if she deserves me and that is the worst she's ever felt, and how she ruined the best thing to ever happen to her. Not only that, she says she feels disgusting for what happened and traumatized because she's never blacked out and had that happen to her. I genuinely think she's being honest with me about her not knowing what happened, and about how terrible she feels. She also says she's never had much of an interaction with this guy before. She met him before spring break, and he messaged her once afterwards inviting her to a party but she didn't respond (and she sent me a screenshot of this). He also messaged her later that day after it happened, trying to get her to come out, and she showed me this. She responded telling him that it was a mistake and all of that. The other day (before any of this had happened) I was questioning if she really only wanted to be with, just because shes never been in an exclusive relationship since high school and that's always sort of bothered me.  She  assured me that she was doing this because she wanted to and she's just never felt that before. She sent me a screenshot of this guy who I think she had gotten with in her past trying to convince her to hook up with him and cheat on me (he said \"one time won't hurt\"). This was the night of another grad party when I remember her being really drunk again. Her response was \"No I'm sorry I don't want that. I love my boyfriend.\". Things like that lead me to believe she's genuine.\n\nOn the other hand, I can't stop thinking about the event actually occurring. At the end of the day, they went back to her room and a lot happened (not sex). It's very hard for me to understanding blacking out and doing all of that, because I'm not the type to get blackout drunk and I don't have much of an idea for what it's like. I can't help but think that deep down maybe this is what she's like -- is she easy? Promiscuous? I don't really know much about her past in college before me. At the end of the day, she cheated on me, and there is a big gap between her doing what she did and how someone should act if they're in a loving relationship. Maybe I'm being too naive and trying to see the best in her. Maybe nothing excuses what she did, and maybe I should find someone else that wouldn't do this to me regardless of the situation. Or maybe she just really isn't used to not putting herself in these situations because she hasnt been in a committed relationship in college, and things will be different from now on.\n\nNot really sure what to expect of the responses here -- people on this forum seem to be too black and white about things. I think the tldr's encourage that type of thinking. At the same time, I haven't talked to anyone about this, and I need to get my thoughts out and some outside opinion on this.\n\n**tl;dr**: GF blacked out and cheated on me, called me right away to tell me.

Now how does it work? Look below.\n\n**How to enter:**\n\n* Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate. \n\n**Important Rules:**\n\n* Only ONE top level (not a reply) comment per person, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments will result in exclusion from entering. Go to /u/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment. Delete any extra duplicates ASAP. \n\n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person. We also have an updated set of guidelines we are following to filter out cheaters, or old alts.\n\n\n\n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n\n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/millionairemakers/comments/2ournt/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n\n**Reminders**\n\n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin you can use [Circle](https://www.circle.com/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it. \n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers\"` or checkout our [IFTTT recipes](/r/jaysamuel/comments/2wnvrw/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes/). \n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between were we made it it in /r/all and donations. \n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.** \n\nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you.

So, from my new News post:\n\n\"As I discussed before, I have set a cut-off of recalculating only the previous two months. This 'sliding window' is necessary, as it is just too demanding to have to recalculate all past games. By drawing the line at the most recent two months, and improving MMR calculations, almost everyone should benefit.\n\nI've just put the new MMR calculations in place tonight, so I'll have to wait a few days to judge how well the service is improved, but I expect MMR calculations to be 2-4 times faster, and require significantly less server resources on my end. This means I should be able to scale easily if a lot of new players join when Heroes of the Storm is officially launched.\n\nAll old calculations and replays will be preserved - so MMR will not be wiped, even past the two month window. Also, new users will be able to upload older games, and these games will show up in their Match History and Profile, they just won't have MMR calculated.\n\nThe only down side with this sliding window, is for new users of HOTS Logs. When a new user joins HOTS Logs and uploads all of their games, unfortunately I will not be able to calculate MMR on newly uploaded games that were played more than two months ago.\n\nI would appreciate it if you users could keep an eye out for any strangeness in MMR calculation results, though. These optimizations I've put in place should not change the MMR calculation algorithm - so MMR results from matches should be the same as they have been. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, let me know!\"\n\nI hope that answers some of your concerns, and again sorry for all the drama caused by this :) Hopefully with these new practices in place, I won't need to make future changes to HOTS Logs MMR, and calculations should be more consistent going forward.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I can answer them in this thread :)\n\nAlso, for you nerdlets who were curious about the performance details of HOTS Logs calculations, here's some info on what I did in the C# code: Basically, I had set up MMR calculations using Entity Framework to access the database.  Unfortunately, this was causing a huge performance hit when calculating MMR on ~100,000 records at once.  I moved away from using these objects, to just giant arrays of integers and decimals.  Part of the problem with Entity Framework, was that it queries all values in a database record, instead of just a specific few I need for MMR.  The end result: Previously, an MMR calculation thread was using about 4gb of memory and maxing out CPU usage for that thread.  The bottleneck used to be CPU.  Now, an MMR calculation thread uses about 100mb of memory, and basically no CPU usage :D The bottleneck now is my database disk write IOPS, and I'm currently in the process of doubling this capacity :D Should be done within a few hours I think.\n\n**tl;dr:** No MMR wipe; MMR changes should only affect new HOTS Logs users, and MMR calculations should be much faster for all users going forward.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13"}, {"score": 5376, "url": "http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7772/17761863929_bb8504a599_k.jpg", "id": "t3_36w5nd", "author": "unknown_name", "title": "Supercell in Weinert, Texas.

We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate. \n\n**Important Rules:**\n\n* Only ONE top level (not a reply) comment per person, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments will result in exclusion from entering. Go to /u/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment. Delete any extra duplicates ASAP. \n\n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person. We also have an updated set of guidelines we are following to filter out cheaters, or old alts.\n\n\n\n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n\n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/millionairemakers/comments/2ournt/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n\n**Reminders**\n\n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin you can use [Circle](https://www.circle.com/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it. \n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers\"` or checkout our [IFTTT recipes](/r/jaysamuel/comments/2wnvrw/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes/). \n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between were we made it it in /r/all and donations. \n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.** \n\nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n\n**Advice:**\n\n* If the community doesn't like you, even if you win, nobody will donate. So don't be a jerk.\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n\nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n\nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n\nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

These are posted automatically by the automoderator every Monday morning at 5am EST, and stay up for an entire week. The normal [self promotion rules](/r/indiegaming/wiki/spam) don't apply to commenting on this post. There is no account age limit, so you can use them even if you're a new redditor. These also don't have the limits on fundraising pleas, so this is a good place for kickstarter reminders. And as comments don't count toward 10%, these posts are also good for minor updates, more frequent devlogs, requests for feedback and the like.\n\nHere's how this works, if you have something to self promote, post a top level comment telling us about it. Include your project name, a link to the project, and your name. This thread will run in contest mode, which means that only top level comments are shown (sub threads are collapsed), so the post looks a bit like a front page of self posts. Also top level comments are in a different pseudorandom order each time you look at the thread. There is no top, new or controversial. So if you leave a self promo comment later in the week, you won't get buried. Everyone gets turns being one of the top comments and one of the bottom comments.\n\nEach top level comment basically functions as it's own mini post. **All top level comments in the weekly thread must be self promotion**, and the replies to each top level comment should be in response to whatever is being promoted.\n\nLike with self promotion posts, you shouldn't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, instead tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting. And like with self promo posts, please participate in any discussion your comment generates.\n\nBecause the order of the top comments changes with each page load, we suggest the following formatting for all top level comments, to make it easier to people to refind your comment with a simple ctrl-f:\n\n  * Project title - title of the game, blog or article  \n  * Promotion Type - fundraising / feedback / etc   \n  * Promoter's name and role - whatever name or username you associate with your project  \n  * Links to the project -   \n  * Text explaining the project. Don't just copy paste over the description or bullet points of the game, tell us why you think we'd like it. Be descriptive, be interesting.  \n\n\nAs always [subreddit rules apply](/r/indiegaming/rules). And remember: top level comments *must* include self promotion.

Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it. \n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers\"` or checkout our [IFTTT recipes](/r/jaysamuel/comments/2wnvrw/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes/). \n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between were we made it it in /r/all and donations. \n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.** \n\nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n\n**Advice:**\n\n* If the community doesn't like you, even if you win, nobody will donate. So don't be a jerk.\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n\nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n\nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n\nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate. \n\n**Important Rules:**\n\n* Only ONE top level (not a reply) comment per person, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments will result in exclusion from entering. Go to /u/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment. Delete any extra duplicates ASAP. \n\n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.

People invest in the market to make a return on capital invested. This, I have no problem with. However, the goals set in pursuit of this, and the strategies employed in this are what make absolutely no sense to me.\n\nThink about what is taught in conventional financial theory and investment management. The number one goal in investment analysis and management is to not only make money, but to beat the market. Managers execute daily trades and attempt to time the market to complete this very objective. However, when I really think about it makes no sense to me, or FOR me. There seems to be this huge focus on beating the market performance. Sometimes I question whether or not that REALLY matters.\n\nMy theory is this\u2026\n\nIf you set a dollar amount to have by a certain age, say $1mm by age 45, then you could actually calculate, based on a certain discount rate, how much you need to invest per period to meet your goal. If this is the case, then why do portfolio managers break their back every day, executing trades daily, dangerously trying to time the market? Why not just specify to clients every quarter whether or not they hit their goal for the quarter, and how much they are above/below target or on track by?\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be much more responsible to set a goal financially and work towards it slowly instead of focusing on market performance in terms of benchmarking?\n\n**EDIT:** Here is a more detailed example of what I mean for those interested.\n\nI\u2019m currently 22 years old. Let\u2019s imagine I have an objective to have $1mm by age 40 and want to achieve this result by aiming to achieve an 8% return per year. I have a balance of $3,000 right now. Lets say I contribute $X per year to achieve this result (I\u2019m not doing the math because I\u2019m lazy. If someone does the math I\u2019ll add the real number but I don\u2019t see the point).\n\nUnder conventional portfolio management technique, the fund managers would invest in the equities/assets that they believe will yield me my desired return. They would have down quarters as well as up quarters and would hope over-time to perform well enough to hit my goal.\n\nHowever, a new and probably unpopular method would be to achieve the desired return, and then exit the market after hitting the performance goal. This would in effect cap gains and limit losses, but the end result is that the long term goal of $1mm by 40 would have been achieved while avoiding significant fluctuation in terms of where the fund is in relation to the goal.\n\nThis is again, un-conventional but I would be interested in hearing thoughts about this investment style.\n\n\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhq"}, {"score": 0, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf9OZd2a5rU", "id": "t3_34jrh7", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "PSA: This guy is a snake oil tool that embarrasses our craft.", "timecreated": 1430507951.0, "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "selftext": "[deleted]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sgp1"}, {"score": 2162, "url": "https://instagram.com/p/2JK3m1LISP/", "id": "t3_34j662", "author": "ccb907", "title": "It's official, Marcus Mariota will wear #8 for the Titans...if he can beat Ryan Succop in an arm wrestling match.", "timecreated": 1430497850.0, "subreddit": "nfl", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmg3"}, {"score": 1, "url": "http://pitchfork.com/news/59457-disclosure-shares-new-track-bang-that/", "id": "t3_34jr0g", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "[FRESH] Disclosure- Bang That", "timecreated": 1430507719.0, "subreddit": "indieheads", "selftext": "[deleted]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zj24"}, {"score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/34jrxf/question_acquiring_removedunavailable_predlc_items/", "id": "t3_34jrxf", "author": "chaferton", "title": "[Question] Acquiring removed/unavailable (pre-DLC) items", "timecreated": 1430508182.0, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "selftext": "A recent post noted that much of the available vendor gear currently available, will be unavailable post HoW drop...similar to what happened when TDB was released - i.e. you cant get Shadow Price anymore.\n\nI am wondering if its possible to uninstall the DLC, for example TDB, get the weapons/armor that you want and then reinstall your DLC.

The Mehal sefari starts with the Drill I promotion (meaning with a military academy they can start with Blitz or March!) and also gains a [](/combat) combat bonus based on it's placement in relation to the location of the [](/capital) capital - this starts at 30% if the unit is on the city tile, and reduces by 3% for every tile away from the capital. The Mehal sefari costs 25 [](/prod) hammers less than the rifleman, and also retains the unique promotion (bonus strength when close to the capital) when upgraded to Great War Infantry. Mehal sefari shouldn't be underrated when fighting against Ethiopia - if they are one tile away from their capital city, they have a [](/combat) combat strength of 49 - that's almost the same as the unit that they upgrade to!\n\n**Stele:** *No tech requirement, replaces Monument*\n\nThis unique building makes Ethiopia particularly interesting - the combination of the unique ability and unique unit make Ethiopia seem geared towards tall play and turtling (which they are extremely good at!), but the Stele makes Ethiopia a viable and extremely strong civilization for wide play! The Stele offers +2 [](/culture) culture and +2 [](/faith) faith, meaning Ethiopia are an excellent choice if you want a religious game. The Stele can almost guarantee you a religion (you get double the [](/faith) faith that a shrine gives without needing a tech!), meaning Ethiopia are capable of outputting an extremely high amount [](/faith) faith.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy**\n\nFor this section, I'm going to refer you to the excellent **[Steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=292079843)** regarding Ethiopia by /u/Zigzagzigal - a guide which includes things to avoid, advice regarding policies and even ways to counter Ethiopia!

This is May's Monthly Challenge, back on track, after a long absence! Did you have fun last month? I hope you did, because now\u2026 we are switching it around! And trust me, I\u2019ve tried it, it\u2019s a proper challenge.\n\nAll you have to do, is play as Ethiopia, on a 10 player map, and win, on any difficulty you please.\n\nOh, and the little detail I mentioned above?\n\nWell, you\u2019re going to be playing against a team of Shaka, Shaka, Shaka, Shaka, Shaka, Shaka, Shaka, Gandhi, and Shaka. On a Pangaea map. Have fuuuun!\n\n**Objective:**\n\nTo win this challenge, obtain any victory (including time), with Ethiopia on a pangea map with 8 shaka\u2019s and one Gandhi on the same team, opposing you.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* You must play as Ethiopia.\n\n* You must play on a large Pangaea map (10 players).\n\n* You must play against a team of 8 Shakas and one Gandhi.\n\n* You must win.\n\n* You must survive! \n\n**Settings:**\n\n* Civilization: Ethiopia\n\n* Victory types enabled: All\n\n* Standard Speed, large map, Pangaea map, ancient era start, legendary start if you wish! \n\n* Any difficulty you wish; of course, you should always be looking to improve your Civ game. That should do it for this month's challenge!\n\n\n**Achievements:**\n\n* *The Weakest Link*  \u2013 Exterminate Gandhi.\n\n* *Cult-ure* \u2013 Force at least one of your enemies to switch to your ideology.\n\n* *Hold the Line!* \u2013 Never lose a single city against the Impocolypse.\n\n* *Out-Shaka\u2019d* \u2013 Obtain a domination victory.\n\n* *Blue Balling The Bonus* \u2013 never build a gunpowder unit until Impis are no longer relevant.\n\n* *And This is Because Fuck You* \u2013 Place a bunch of citadels next to a Shaka\u2019s capital, stealing all the land around it, reducing it to a mere city-state\n\n* *Exploiting the Weakness* \u2013 Obtain 2 great admirals, without the exploration policy (note, if you want to obtain this, show off 2 great admirals and a shot of your policy trees)\n\n* *The Great Raid* \u2013 Assemble an army of horse-type units and pillage every single tile available to you.\n\n* *War Profiteering* \u2013 Finish the Honour policy tree and pick God of War as your follower belief.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* [](/prod) Production and [](/science) science are king!\n\n* Consider not giving embassies, and maybe don\u2019t explore too much. The later you meet someone, the more time you have to prepare for what\u2019s heading your way!\n\n* FOR THE LOVE OF POLDERS, BEELINE CONSTRUCTION AND MACHINERY. You\u2019ll be able to thank me later.\n\n* Shaka wont have much of a navy, so any coastal cities are possibly less defended then any land city.\n\n* Don\u2019t let Gandhi get nukes!\n\n* Remember that galleases and frigates can attack land troops! This can help defend your coastal cities if necessary!\n\n* Defence is priority - you can level up your troops and then mount a counter attack with your newly promoted troops!\n\n* Remember, that if things are going slightly south, you can always hope one of the Shakas wants to make peace (this happens more often then you think) and thus you get a while to build up, refocus, and then continue to attack/defend!\n\n*Huge thanks to everyone who takes part in these, and please leave some feedback if you like it!*\n\n---\n\n**[Vote here for the next Civ of the Month!](http://strawpoll.me/4246103)**\n\n---\n\n**[The prior featured Civs index is now available on the subreddit wiki.](http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/wiki/threadindex#wiki_civ_of_the_month)**", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rk3b"}, {"score": 38, "url": "http://www.xceedspeed.com/forums/showthread.php?t=239878", "id": "t3_34j0xx", "author": "pukingfratbro", "title": "Guy tries to sell car.

I'm in my early 40s, a musician, currently in the Army with 3 years left, and have an opportunity to work with my dad and this monster he's created and eventually take it over.\n\nIn the 90s my dad and his wife amassed quite a lot of money in the printing and mailing business and in the past few years he is on a buying real estate binge.  Right now he has around 80-90 \"doors\" as he calls them.  Every property is completely paid for.  Some need work and he gets it done.  \n\nRight now all of this is under two companies as I understand it.  Honestly this is part of the grey area that I don't yet get.  It appears some of the properties are in my dad's name and some are in his wife's name, my stepmother.  There is an accountant, 2 property management companies, an attorney, and a handful of maintenance workers on the payroll.  Each of the properties are what I would call median income to high income properties.  Sorry if that's not the right terminology.  This is all in Tennessee.\n\nMy plan is to serve out my Army contract and then get to work with my dad.  I have a little more than 3 years to get ready.  My background is in music.  I don't really know anything about real estate or business. \n\nMy options are to get some degree during my remaining time in the Army concurrent with my service or after... or not at all.  If I choose to get a degree, I really don't which one that would be the most helpful.  An MBA seems a likely option or something in management that, honestly, appeals to me more.  (I have a bachelor's already)\n\nBut do I really need a degree at all?  If all the legal, property management, bookkeeping, and maintenance is farmed out, then what would I need with a degree?  I just don't want to waste my time.  I feel like there's something huge that I'm missing, that I am being incredibly naive due to my ignorance.  This seems too easy.\n\nYou might be wondering why I don't just talk with my dad about it.  I have, but he's not the most organized with this business.

Wondering if anyone else does this/if anyone else thinks this is wrong or bad.\n\nOur daughter is 14mo and so she is transitioning from 2 to 1 day sleeps. When she is awake she is busy busy busy.\n\nUsually in the afternoon (around 4:30) she gets a bit restless and grumpy but doesn't want a sleep. As per usual anyway, we will have a warm bottle and I will lay her down in her bed as if she is going to sleep. \n\nSome days she will sleep, fine. Other days she just has a \"rest\" where she lays in her cot, babbles, sucks her dummy, plays with her blanky and soft toys, kicks the cot etc. This usually lasts about half an hour until I can hear she wants to get up.\n\nThere is usually intermittent silence (perhaps quick 5 min naps) and I will never leave her to cry or get distressed. \n\nI just figure, its nice for her to have a chill out, de-stress time, alone, where she can sleep if she wants or just roll around and babble. If she cries or fusses, I will get her out and we continue as normal. This isn't a forced thing. \n\nIt also  allows me a great 20-30 mins to run around, tidy up, cut some potatoes or whatever, do some yoga, make a phone call.. whatever. I'm sure you all know how useful 30 mins can be.\n\nSo really just wondering what other peoples thoughts are on this! Good/bad..

So glad to hear! The comment that made me self conscious was that I did this only to get her out of the way for some time while I cleaned.

The problem is that by doing so they are also completely gutting her solo lane potential.\n\nI've been a Karma main for 4 years now and I mostly play her mid and top. I think she's pretty balanced, even as a support, but I'm not against changes if Riot thinks she needs them. The problem is that they're trying to completely change her role, shoehorning her into bottom lane (despite the fact that when Scarizard reworked her he clearly was going for a mage with support capabilities and not the other way around).\n\nI don't know why they're doing this, as they could definitely keep both roles viable and even buff her with something like [these less drastic changes I came up with.](http://i.imgur.com/E3HeCJv.jpg)\n\nThe removal of the damage component on R+E and the huge nerf to her self-heal and damage on R+W are the biggest offenders. These changes could definitely make top/mid Karma go from viable to shit tier. I understand the changes are tentative and testing, but as we all know it wouldn't be the first time PBE changes just get pushed to live without taking player feedback into consideration. Rito pls.\n\nEdit: some math by /u/seanfidence:\n> So here's some math about the W change. I see a lot of people saying that the spellvamp mechanic is a buff, you have to understand how it works. In terms of literal strength, the change on the PBE might be a buff, it might make her a great support. BUT, the new W will make Karma heal less for herself.\n\n> Currently, the R-W heals for 20% of your missing health on cast, and then 20% of your missing health if the root is activated, with each healing for an addition 1% per 100 AP. Even if I completely ignore the AP ratios, this is clearly a nerf to Karma's self-healing, so we'll just ignore them.\n\n> Let's take a common scenario. At level 8 Karma has 1002 base health. So let's say you're sitting at 302 HP/1002 HP, missing exactly 700. If you were to cast the current W on a target, you would instantly heal 140 HP (20% of 700) and then the second proc would heal 112 HP (20% of the now missing 560). HP5 is negligible.\n\n> Okay, so new Karma has a 10% damage amp + heals 20% of all damage done to the target. Old heal in that scenario would heal for 252. So, you'd have to deal a cumulative 1260 damage to the target during that 3-4 second window (depending on W rank) in order to match that. Since that 1260 is amplified by 10%, **you will now need to deal 1146 damage during that 3-second window in order to match the old heal. This number only grows larger if Karma is missing more health - at level 18 the number is approximately doubled.**\n\n> This is CLEARLY a nerf to Karma's self-healing. The new mechanic that heals allies is kinda cool, I'll admit, but this is 100% a shift away from a midlane and toplane mage towards a team-reliant support, there's no other way around it.

For a second offence 2-3 minutes seems much more reasonable.\n\nBounce whips could be changed to not jail at all\n\n- (if possible) After the first whip removing you from the plot the second whip prevents you from going onto the plot for a time, tping you away if you attempt to enter similar to the first whip but automatic.\n\nFind a way to fix the chair glitch\n\n- I'm not sure this is possible but if players could be removed from the plot on the first whip even if sitting in a chair, also removing them from the chair on the second, third, ect whips that would be much better.\n\nNot being jailed on death (in my opinion the \"dying is illegal\" reason is just a crutch because there needs to be a consequence for death)\n\n- Have a separate area for players who die with something to do other than stand around for 10 minutes, parkour, mazes, ect.\n\n- Shorten the time dead players are jailed from 10 minutes to 5 (lets be real half the time you die you just log out for an hour or so/ tab out for awhile and its not any fun)\n\n- Players who die are given a ghost form for 5-10 minutes while being resurrected.

I'm talking about nargacuga, of course. What? You thought I meant Seregios? Well I guess Steve also fits that bill. Regardless, some monsters use their scales as a weapon, flinging them from their body in an attempt to kill other things. How viable is this? I mean, when you think about it, an arrow is only dangerous if it hits you on one point of the entire body of the arrow. These monsters must have either perfectly aerodynamic scales or sharp edges on all sides.\n\nHonestly though, scale shooting is one of my favorite design choices in MH, since not *everything* should be able to have some sort of elemental breath. It's a nice little bit of diversity, and it does make some sense.\n\nSeregios and Nargacuga both do this as an attack, but doesn't it seem like they'd run out of scales after a while? If Seregios has 1000 blades, but every time he fires scales he shoots 6 or so, then that's only around 166 times he can use that. Lucent Nargacuga is even worse! How many scales does it shoot? His tail probably falls off simply from getting startled. The only explanation is that they produce scales really quickly, since there's no way anything could just casually shed it's arms and armor every time it felt threatened. If that were the case, though, then using scales as a weapon is probably something they do regardless, simply to keep fresh ones coming in. We find Kut Ku scales around certain honey gathering points, and that's presumably because the kut ku shed a scale there, so it's not out of the question that nargacuga and seregios both just shed scales regularly. There's no real way to find out, but in my head that seems pretty reasonable.\n\nLots of things moult or shed scales or hair. My cat never seems to stop shedding. If only cats could figure out a way to use their hairs... like a porcupine.\n\nLet me tell you about porcupines. Porcupines are my honest natural born enemy. Although I don't live there any more, I grew up in the far far backwoods of Northern Ontario, 6 kilometers from the nearest neighbors. I had to take a boat to get to the car to then drive an hour to school every morning. We had electricity from a gasoline generator for a long time, but then at some point we moved to solar panels and batteries. And let me tell you, porcupines *love* the taste of our battery container (they like the taste of plywood for some reason).\nIf you've ever wondered why it takes so long to kill a level 140 Kut Ku, or a Great Jaggi in the very beginning of the game, even with a big sword that could probably decapitate them in one swing, then you've never met the demon spawn that are porcupines. I don't like killing anything in real life, but if they started eating the battery container, there was no choice. We can't let them ruin the batteries (a huge monetary investment), and they're not just going to go away. In short, I could stick my finger through a hole in a porcupines skull before it finally stopped being alive. They moan too like nothing you've ever heard. It honestly sounds like a human with a gag in his mouth trying to scream. I hate hate hate hate hate the sounds of porcupines.\n\nRegardless of that little story from my childhood that still haunts me, porcupines are one of the best candidates for a real life example of what a nargacuga or seregios might be doing. If you ever thought a porcupine shot a quill, well then you're wrong. It's more just like shedding them when it wants to, but those spines don't \"shoot\" anywhere. Imagine just shedding a hair. That's what a porcupine does. Except porcupines don't move quickly. \n\nIf you held an arrow, and then let go of it, you wouldn't be \"shooting\" an arrow. You'd be dropping an arrow. Sure, if somebody fell on that arrow and then you let go, it wouldn't fall to the ground, but you wouldn't be \"shooting\" an arrow. This is our hell beast porcupine. If you instead moved your arm and let go of the arrow, you'd be \"shooting,\" the arrow. Actually that's just called throwing an arrow, but it's the same thing. Now think of the movements that nargacuga and seregios do to shoot their scales. Seregios does some sort of lunge, or swipes his tail. He's moving, and then not moving, and then you get hit by scales. Nargacuga is the same story. He slams and swings his tail and then spikes come shooting out. Both of them are *throwing* their scales.\n\nBack to porcupines now. Porcupines have very few predators, since not many creatures really want to put their mouths around the pincushion of Beelzebub. If you have a dog and live in an area with porcupines, then you probably know what a dog with quills in its mouth looks like. Thankfully most dogs give up pretty easily, because those quills can cause bloodloss and really nasty infections, and have been known to kill. Porcupines even swing their tails around to hit things (they have a small tail, but can't blame them for trying). These quills grow back at around the speed of normal hair.\n\nImagine your head. Now imagine instead of having [120,000 beautiful silken hairs upon your head](http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?&id=101509), you had 30,000 sharp needles. Every couple months they would be as longs they could get. Anything intelligent would probably develop a use for those needles. If you were a predator, that's a lot of needles to use as a weapon. Porcupines can kill the occasional especially unintelligent mountain lion, and porcupines have rocks for brains. Seregios or Nargacuga, with their relative hyper intelligence, could probably kill the occasional especially genius mountain lion, and they'll slaughter any of their prey.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SEREGIOS AND NARGACUGA, VIABLE/NOT VIABLE? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSee, now the problem I've been having is that there's no way to guide a scale. They don't have any sort of way to make sure that the pointy end hits you. And then, you try throwing hair at somebody. Unless that person is right next to you, that hair isn't going to connect. These monsters need to fly, it's unlikely that their scales are going to be very heavy. Seregios is basically throwing a handful of razor blades. If they hit you, they don't do very much damage. If they get a *good hit* on you, then be prepared to eat some well done meat. This is how I imagine things would be if seregios were real. Many of those scales *aren't* going to hit you straight on, but if they do then they're going to be rather painful.\n\nSeregios' scales look like they grow in a specific pattern, perfectly covering the root of other scales, and since we don't ever see a bald spot on dear Steve, I assume that the scales grow on top of another, and form a bit like shark teeth (with a new tooth right behind the old one). Instead of moulting, and leaving a big husk like I assume a najarala or god forbid a dalamadur would do, Seregios's old scales simply stay attached, to be used at a later time.\n\nWhen you cut seregios' tail, he doesn't shoot as many scales from his tail. Makes sense: he has less scales to shoot, and the tail's whip like motion would naturally send scales farther.\n\nNargacuga on the other hand shoots significantly more spines in one tail swing. They're much smaller, however. These look almost like porcupine quills, and if there's 30k quills on a porcupine, and a porcupine is the size of a small dog or 1.5 human heads, then who can say how many spines nargacuga has. It has the ability to make the spikes stand on end like Steve, but these are only on its tail. Regardless, it's even less likely that one of these spikes will hit at the right angle to make any sort of damage. Seregios scales are sharp on the tip and the edges, seeing as they easily cut deep into the ace lancer's shield, but nothing indicates that the edges of Panthrex's spines are *sharp*. If you were tenacious enough, you could pet a porcupine without getting stuck. If you were stupid enough, I'm assuming you could do the same with Narga. \n\nHave you ever picked up a stick and thrown it like a spear? Likelihood is that it didn't fly like a spear, but instead kinda span and hit the ground at an angle. Nargacuga doesn't fly as much as seregios, so the spines might be heavier, but try it's still not as likely. Maybe his tail works like an [Atlatl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear-thrower), and the spines just happen to be perfectly lined up when they're released, but *even then* to use an atlatl you have to be very careful not to put spin into your throw, lest you want your spears to bounce harmlessly off the target.\n\n... I have, however, been neglecting another possibility. I genuinely hope you didn't go and pet a nargacuga tail, because you're probably already dead. Perhaps the spines on a nargacuga aren't supposed to act like spears. There is one animal, one vile, festering pest that uses its hairs as a weapon by throwing them. Even for the size of the creature, and the size of the hairs, people have (edit: had a hard time breathing). I speak of certain North and South American tarantulas. These tarantulas use their legs to rub hairs off their body, which they then throw at threats. It doesn't matter if the points of the hairs stick, since these hairs are covered in irritating barbs. Actually, Caterpillars have this too. If you ever heard how you're not supposed to touch certain caterpillars, this is why. \n\nTarantulas are gross and these urticating hairs can be (edit) very harmful if you breath them in, but on caterpillars they can be deadly simply by touching the skin. Plants have this too. These caterpillar hairs are connected to **poison producing cells** which is what can kill a human. I argue that *this* is what a nargacuga spine is. It's a large quill in size and shape, but it's an urticating hair in function. It has tiny bristles that act like little hypodermic needles. Nargacuga, like tarantulas, throw these hairs at threats. Instead of the pointy end of the quill doing damage, it's instead the entire quill that hurts you. Tiny barbs on the sides of the quills stick into you, causing you to itch the skin that's being torn apart where it connected. Even worse, it might be poisoning you.\n\n[Urticating Hair](http://tarantulas.tropica.ru/files/images/urticating_hairs_1.jpg) (protip: don't look up urticating hair on google image search. Gross stuff)\n\nIn fact, porcupine quills also have tiny barbs, but only at the tip (to ensure that they stay in the target for extra damage). If the tiny barbs were larger extended down the length of the porcupine quill, it'd likely also be urticating, or at least aggressively annoying and painful to touch.\n\n[Tip of a porcupine quill, notice the little edges](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/files/2012/12/Porcupine-quill.jpg)\n\nTL;DR Seregios throws handfuls of razor blades at you, relying on one of them to hit you at the right angle. Nargacuga throws a bunch of quills at you and doesn't care what angle they hit you at because they'll work their way into hurting you regardless, perhaps even poisoning you. As a result, throwing scales seems at least partially viable to me.\n\n\n\nWord of advice: if you happen to be the proud owner of a petting zoo, don't put seregios or nargacuga in it. Something tells me that they're not fun to touch...\n\n\nEdit: WOOOWEE A LONG ONE BOYS.

Simply put, any significant depletion of resources is not going to happen for many years.\n\nHere is my theory:\n\nThe increasing defense levels of vaults is very alarming. Vaults have been broken in the past, but the current vaults far surpass the ones of today, and it is much easier to scale the defenses of a vault than it is to scale the effectiveness of attacks. We have reached a point in the server where structures have been built that cannot be broken, and we know that the owners of the structure have the power to shut a player out from the overworld indefinitely.\n\nI'm going to use relevant parties as examples for my theory, but please note if this happens later down the road, expect different groups to occupy this conflict.\n\nLibertas and WP have actively opposed each other since the beginning, and both have the means to hold any member of the opposing side in the end indefinitely. For this reason, the two sides have entered a state of Cold War. Either side can win a defensive battle, and either side will lose as the attackers.\n\nBecause of this, Libertas and WP will take sides in a series of foreign conflicts, a set of proxy wars if you will. The first may be upon us soon, as Kaiserin and SPQR devolve into a state of war. WP and Libertas rush to take one side against the other, exerting their strength and skill upon one another.\n\nThe conflict in the deep -,- is the first of many to come. Some conflicts will spur from organic cause, some will be artificially crafted through the use of propaganda, or faked evidence. Little cues will be magnified, creating a catalyst for another conflict.\n\nEventually, most neutral parties will have been effected by this conflict in one way or another, and at some point, the entire server will have polarized into two sides. Fighting will take place all over the world, with fighters on both sides being pearled through victory and defeat at every battle along the way, locked away in mega vaults with no hope of escape.\n\nAs the fighters within the core group on both sides dwindle ever low, both sides begin recruiting their sovereign allies, arming them with gear and sending them into the heat of battle.\n\nResources take a noticeable hit on both sides, and more fighters are pearled. Battles are now occurring more frequently than ever before. Everyone has a group associated with them, and nobody is innocent. Public transport is no longer safe. Rails linking opposing cities are griefed, and both sides set up groups to patrol different modes of transport, pearling anyone of the other side they cross paths with.\n\nAs fighting continues, a major flaw is revealed with the vaults. There are only so many players that can be imprisoned. As more and more fighters are defeated, tresspassers, raiders, and thiefs previously imprisoned in the megavaults are released to make room for the fighters.\n\nFunds continue to diminish, most belligerent neutral parties are armed, and all of those that are not actively advocating against the war are offered gear. Players are brought in from other communities and games, but it has gotten to a point where it is hard to muster up a single set of prot for the recruits. Many are given junk enchants are plain gear.\n\nAs more players are pearled, the remaining funds are pulled together to create secondary vaults. Nobody on the map is actively producing bastions, but there is enough obsidian to create decently protected vaults. Diamonds are becoming increasingly scarcer, but some players on each side cough up their personal reserves to fund smaller, 8-12 thick vaults. It's risky for players to actively mine out vault holes, as a mining load out is an easy target, so vaults are built in vacant pits throughout the map. \n\nThe last battles of the war are of a new breed. The last resources are pulled together to arm a dozen players. These players are given a mission to pop secondary vaults. These vaults are nothing like the mega vaults of today, and many of them are successfully popped, however many men and resources are lost through these vault breaks, and it is quickly realized that freeing a few comrades is not worth the cost.\n\nAround this time, another problem arises. News of this war, The \"Great War\" has spread to other communities. HCF players, many who are already aware of the server, flock to the server in the spirit of war. Videos of massive warfare and incredible destruction are shared throughout the Minecraft community, and many players join in hopes of participating in this chaos.\n\nBy this point, many of the civcrafters being to show their true colors. Everyone has been effected by the war at this point, with everyone having lost a friend, a build, a town, or a treasure. Many quit Civcraft altogether, but many choose to turn bad, thrashing nearby settlements and killing fighters among both sides to take out their anger.\n\nOrganized groups of outsiders, as well as reckless abandons from the inside, amass wealth. Many players did not donate their personal fortunes to the war, either out of selfishness or opposition to the war. These individuals still have ample supplies, but they stand no chance against larger groups looking for blood.\n\nThese tight knit, organized groups of raiders and individual barbarians are able to put together enough supplies to arm themselves with prot and potions. They begin creating their own vaults with whatever resources they come across, and imprisoning everyone they can. Eventually, the remaining WP and Libertas understand their world is ending as they know it, and agree to begin releasing fighters.\n\nThe two forces begin arming themselves once again, this time to fight a common enemy. In some instances, victory is achieved. Many of the lone raiders are caught and beaten down. However, in many cases victory not awarded. The raiding groups of foreigners are well coordinated, out geared, and better at pvp. The WP and Libertas forces are outnumbered, and dying at a quicker rate than the criminals.\n\nAt some point, it becomes apparent that the former leaders and vault owners of the previously reigning groups have no possibility of returning to their positions of power without help of the current power groups. Alliances are made between several of the original people of power and individual raiding groups. Owners of the megavaults hand over their last remaining possession in exchange for a sovereign life among the new world order.\n\nThe last remaining fighters between WP and Libertas come together, in a last ditch effort to end this chaos. One, maybe two dozen players armed with their last set of prot and inventory of potion band together to stop as many outlaws as possible.\n\nAt first, this group is successful. Some raiding groups are not well equipped, or particularly skilled at pvp. The group that migrated from a minigame hub was defeated in a decisive battle in Commonwealth. A group of several raiders from Chanada was defeated in NDZ.\n\nAs some groups are being defeated, however, others are getting stronger. An alliance of four Kohi factions recently gained control of clone's vault (? the one by Orion). They've pearled every player located in the Orion-Haven-Etherium region, and are currently working on popping every chest in the -,-.\n\nSeveral thousand blocks away, some of the former HCF players that were higher ups in Libertas have teamed up with their brethren from their past server. They have full control of the Libertas vault, and are cracking down on any remaining player from the Mt Augusta region to the Fellowship region. \n\nOther powerhouses are forming in other parts of the map, a group of Spaniard control Carson and Carbon, and are closing in on Commonwealth. One group set up shop in the abandoned city of minas minas, and have silently been fortifying the area into a super fortress.\n\nAs these groups gain power, it becomes apparent that the remaining WP/Libertas forces are out of luck. The group eventually splits up because a common goal cannot be reached. Some players continue to liberate areas outside of the danger zones. Some attack the power groups head on, in a serious of terrorist attacks and gorilla assaults.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the forces are thinning out, running out of food, and low on durability. Over time, morality hits rock bottom. Some players attempt one last suicide mission into the heart of the criminals, some continue struggling until they are overcome. Some are simply bested by the environment.\n\nIn an alternative dimension, the end is bustling with activity. A large majority of the civcraft population has quit, but some continued to play in the end, having hope that some miracle will bring about better days. Mandy is now in charge of the largest nation on Civcraft. Many who protested the war migrated to the end on their own free will, bringing along their most valuable possessions in support of the expansion of La Paz.\n\nDespite this prosperity, Mandy understands that she must maintain a sustainable nation. Many end inhabitants, primarily those who took an active role in the war, are denied from entrance into La Paz. Not wanting to give up, many strike deals with the overworld power houses. Some are released from the end playing the role of slaves, some bribe their pearl owners with payments, and some scavenge in the end, attempting to create their own lives.\n\nIn the overworld, it is impossible to start playing on civcraft without affiliation to a group. Most newfriends hear about the server because of the war, and are fully aware of the environment they are entering. Some attempt to live hermit lifestyles under the noses of the World Powers. Some attempt to join these powers, offering different services in exchange for acceptance. However, many, many newfriends are pearled without getting their foot in the ground, and end populations continue to increase.\n\nIn the end, the peaceful mood is evidently changing. Many of the La Paz rejects have created their own nation. Comprised of many of the belligerents from the Great War, these people sought the complete destruction of La Paz, in retaliation for their denial.\n\nThe major flaw with La Paz was the playerbase, Mandy wanted to make sure her citizens were safe, goodwilled people, and as a result, Mandy did not have an adequate army. When the day finally came, the walls of La Paz were breached, citizens homes were demolished, and the infrastructure of the nation destroyed. Mandy was killed during this attack, and nobody has heard or seen her since.\n\nThroughout this conflict, TTK watched in horror as his work imploded before him. The subreddit is now dominated by the power players that have established themselves after the war. Some of the Civcrafters from prior to the conflict attempt to voice their own opinions. They advocate for a map reset, because their years of hard work have completely gone to shit and they need to start anew. However, this is the opinion of only a miniscule minority, and these opinions are promptly downvoted.\n\nAfter the destruction on La Paz, the only remaining civilization TTK felt was worthy of playing on the server, a thread was posted. \"What's next?\" Was the title. The thread was created by TTK, but unlike his previous topics of many years before, this one was not accompanied by any text elaborating his inquiry.\n\nThe thread got thousands of replies; the last civcrafters who kept up with the server rallied their old friends to get on the sub to advocate for a map reset. The hundreds current players argued that the server was just fine, and it was the prior players' faults for the current state of the server.\n\nSanwi, one of the more influential civcrafters that remained active on the sub, stated, \"Civcraft is a social experiment. This current server is not an experiment, its a barbaric server marked by war and destruction. Civcraft is supposed to reflect civilization, it was supposed to reflect the real world. This was NOT what was supposed to happen.\"\n\nThe thousands of civcrafters who were recruited to participate in the thread upvoted the comment, and it became number one on the thread.\n\nMany people gave their two cents on the comment, but the only one that matters was a single response, a simple 4 words.\n\nMatthew1034, the infamous player who pearled Hantzu in an ingenious fashion, made his first appearance since that fateful event. His response was simple. \"This is human nature.\"\n\nWith that, TTK made his sole comment in the thread. He replied to Matthew with a simple message. \"Thank you for your contribution.\"\n\nThat response by TTK was the last anyone heard of him, or of the server. Immediately following TTK's reply, the server was shutdown, and the subreddit deleted. The power groups returned to their old servers, and all that was left was the last core group of civcrafters that experienced the war, who had now experienced their last strain of hope vanish into thin air. The mumble remained up, and some people still used it. The mumble was not the same place it used to be, it was inhabited by a small group of people who all had the same single opinion. \n\n*We spent years working towards our goals on the server, but we allowed ourselves to destroy everything.*", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tm1t"}, {"score": 8, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/10/snp-english-national-identity-class-cultural-divide", "id": "t3_35j0bd", "author": "DeathHamster1", "title": "Paul Mason - \"I do not want to be English \u2013 and any attempt to create an English identity will fail\"", "timecreated": 1431292195.0, "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv"}, {"score": 13, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblemcasual/comments/35j60o/how_was_your_day_fireemblemcasual/", "id": "t3_35j60o", "author": "SgtKibbles", "title": "How was your day /fireemblemcasual?", "timecreated": 1431295202.0, "subreddit": "fireemblemcasual", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_342g7"}, {"score": 143, "url": "http://imgur.com/a/bA3BF", "id": "t3_35e2o7", "author": "Half-H3ro", "title": "So the new Simpsons LEGO Minifigures came out!

I am about to finish up a double degree in  Aeronautical Engineering and Finance which I have done fairly well in (distinction average). In terms of jobs for next year, I am leaning towards something in finance, because I have enjoyed that more in the last couple years, and also the lack of a developed aerospace industry in Australia.\n\nHowever, in the last couple of months I have been thinking about my career in the longer term, and am keen to learn more about computer science in that regard. I have had exposure to programming through engineering and other things (such as project euler), and have really enjoyed it - I also like the potential compatibility it has with finance in terms of future career opportunities.\n\nIs a formal education at uni a good option for software engineering? I have tried to learn as much as I can outside uni, but I have found it hard to get continuity in learning as my actual uni subjects get really busy on a regular basis. I have found some decent resources for programming online, but I haven't really found much for computer science concepts in general (like, I can understand the syntax/logic of a piece of code, but wouldn't really know how to optimise efficiency). I also don't really know how much I could do if I get a full time job next year (would depend on the job - some would require a lot of hours).\n\nThe other thing is I know some Masters are aimed at people coming from industry to specialise, etc, which obviously I would struggle a lot to keep up with. So I would be looking at a course that starts from a more basic level. Or another undergrad.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is if a formal education is worth it in terms of its benefits when applying for jobs and actually developing a good understanding of concepts? The courses are fairly expensive, and I will have to sacrifice a couple years working at the same time, but I am very interested in the field and I think I would regret not pursuing it.\n\nCheers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm"}, {"score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/35hqce/which_monsters_would_be_the_best_moms/", "id": "t3_35hqce", "author": "hipstercabbage", "title": "Which monsters would be the best moms?", "timecreated": 1431267327.0, "subreddit": "MonsterHunter", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rron"}, {"score": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaming4Gamers/comments/35j2n6/motion_blur_are_there_even_games_where_its_handed/", "id": "t3_35j2n6", "author": "trullard", "title": "Motion blur.

I'm just gonna be super-honest with my wife and work on myself and my issues.   Hopefully she will stick it out with me because I will be crushed if she doesn't, but I realize it's all my fault.\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo the story is, I had a vegas trip with some guy buddies a few weeks ago and my wife found a condom box in my luggage just now (long story on how this happened, but mostly just dumb on my part).  We've been married two years and been together 5.  I've never cheated on her, but do admit I get the itch from time to time that I usually just have to force to go away.  While I didn't specifically plan on cheating on her during the trip, I was def. open to and brought the condoms in case an opportunity came up. \n\nAfter my wife found the condom box, she was obviously very upset.  I told her I didn't actually use any of them, which I think she believes me (it's true), but she is hurt that I had planned on it.\n\nShe then kicked me out of the house for the night and sent me a long text about how she can't believe that I was throw away my marriage for a cheap fuck and how she thought we were so happy and how all her friends think I'm such a great guy when i'm really not.  \n\nAll of this brings me to my question.  Am I the only one that feels like guys have to give up so much more of themselves to be married than girls do? I love, love, love my wife, but everything I have done to get ahead in life since I was 12 has been ultimately driven by the desire to sleep with as many women as possible and all the males I know are the same way.  It is so very hard to give that up, and I feel like most women don't have to change such a big part of their personality in order to get married.  The petulant child in me just feels like it's so not fair.  \n\nLastly, and I know this has turned into a rant, any advice on what to do to gain my wife's trust back.  It really was just a silly weak moment and despite all I have said, I love and want to be with my wife forever. We have a great relationship and I realize how dumb I am for threatening that.  I'm upset with myself that I have caused her so much pain and have no idea what to do to make it right.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2reak"}, {"score": 21, "url": "http://www.pixlee.net/kingsman-the-secret-service-is-a-terrible-movie-for-terrible-people/", "id": "t3_366zyo", "author": "kingofthefeminists", "title": "(spoiler alert for Kingsmen; not tumblr): Black antagonist committing mass genocide is justified because he's black, his sidekick is white, and his supporters were democratically elected.", "timecreated": 1431805480.0, "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vizz"}, {"score": 13, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3671fk/what_champ_can_you_just_not_play_no_matter_how/", "id": "t3_3671fk", "author": "Barek42", "title": "What champ can you just not play no matter how many times you play them?", "timecreated": 1431806272.0, "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "selftext": "For me I simply can not get the hang of Jinx, no mobility is a killer.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx"}, {"score": 41, "url": "http://imgur.com/i7tCtIT", "id": "t3_365iuu", "author": "NosillaWilla", "title": "I just joined the truck brotherhood!

We're talking surfer attitude without the lingo. He's a go with the flow kind of guy but isn't afraid to speak up when he wants to be heard. Not afraid to change his mind about things if given enough information and a little push in the right direction. I mean, he joined Hydra after all.\n* ***Backstory***- Growing up in Michigan wasn't as bad as people would of thought. Not if you could control sand and lived near the Sleeping Bear Dunes. For fun he would often take a snowboard and use his powers to propel himself down the giant dunes. It was exactly like snowboarding except without the snow. At this point you're probably wondering why he would join Hydra. Yeah, well... Let's talk about his other hobby. While he was sandboarding, he was almost ran over by a dune buggy. That's when he lost all respect for people. Using the sand, he created a pillar under the front right tire and flipped the buggy, watching it roll down the hill in a disastrous crash. Luckily for the two people in the buggy, they lived. From this point on he used his sand to do all sorts of things to people who would piss him off. Thankfully it took a lot to piss him off or the authorities would have been called on him or worse... SHIELD.\n\n***\n*Maxwell saunters through the hallways of the castle.

I had already established before that I only do friends-with-benefits, but that night I told her that the reason I only do fwb is because I got cheated on and I'll never trust another woman again. She also got cheated on by a guy and she acted empathetic. \n\nYesterday morning, she called me thrice and texted me a lot. I ignored all of it. I texted her mid-day and told her not to call me in the morning because I'm either sleeping or working out (which I was). \n\nYesterday night, she texted me about how she wanted to cuddle. I told her (in person) that I only cuddle after sex. She said I was funny, but when I was about to leave her room she yanked my hoodie and started escalating. I was a bit aloof, laughing my ass off. \n\nAnyway, we fucked and everything. But during pillow talk she asked me if I would ever marry a black girl (context: she's black). I told her that's a retarded question because obviously I'm not racist and I wouldn't exclude a certain race from my potential marriage partners. I had told her before that I'd only marry if I found a good girl (i.e a unicorn), but I made it clear I don't think I'll ever find one. \n\n**I'm 99% sure** I am her alpha fucks... I've only known her for 8 days and she slept with me already and she even asked me if we're fwb now (which I said yes to). However... there's this feeling gnawing at me, like she only fucked Alpha-Grundy to get her foot in the door to turn me into a beta... it sounds really paranoid and stuff but I genuinely think she's trying to transform me into a beta. Which makes no fucking sense to me, because why the fuck would she do that when she's attracted to Alpha-Grundy, not Beta-Grundy. WHY?! Why the fuck did she ask me if I would marry a black girl? I clearly established that we're fwb!\n\nMy best guess is that I've accidentally established myself as a \"Dark Triad\", meaning she sees me as some wounded wolf that's really a puppy at heart, and she's gonna try to \"fix\" me or some bullshit like that. \n\n**As much as I love general input, for this particular case I'd like to ask that only people with experience answer.

I've unintentionally lost like 5 pounds this last semester from a lack of appetite and stress, and now I feel weak and I think I look weak too (no idea if I lost more fat or muscle).\n\nAnyway, I had been thinking I want to put on like 7 pounds of muscle while maintaining the same amount of fat, but maybe I should actually be losing fat? I just measured my waist/hip/bust (34-25-34) to find out my body fat percentage, and the website I looked at said I was at like 33%, which is overweight. \n\nI would think that was a incorrect measurement but that is the second time I have been measured as overweight.

Right now I think I just look like an average skinny chick. But maybe I am deluding myself?

And yes, I mean the real disorder, not that bullshit \u201cI\u2019m just anal and like my things organized\u201d OCD that 90% of the population claims that they have. \n\nI\u2019m sure most of you know or at least have an idea of what OCD is, but I\u2019ll go ahead and explain it. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is an anxiety disorder, characterized by invasive thoughts (obsessions) that produce apprehension, fear, worry, and behaviors (compulsions) intended to alleviate the associated anxiety. For example, someone believes that they have come in contact with germs. In turn, their brain tells them they\u2019re going to contract an illness and die, so they wash their hands, oftentimes repeatedly until they no longer feel this way. Or, someone fears they\u2019ve left their oven on, which will catch the house on fire and kill their whole family. As a result, they have to go back and make sure the oven is in fact turned off before they can feel better. However, some of these obsessions and compulsions don\u2019t have to be directly related to each other. For example, someone may have to alphabetize his or her DVDs or a loved one might die (ahem). There are a *multitude* of thoughts and behaviors that accompany this disorder, but for the sake of being concise, I won\u2019t list them for you. If you\u2019re really that interested, you can do some research.\n\nNow, to someone without OCD, these things must sound irrational. Believe me, we know how absurd and ridiculous it is, but our mind says, \u201cdo this or something bad will happen and it will be your fault.\u201d Seriously, it makes NO fucking sense to us either and frustrates us just as much.\n\nOkay, I apologize for the deviation, but I didn\u2019t want anyone to be confused. \n\nEven though I can\u2019t truly pinpoint when it started, I do recall it being around fifth or sixth grade. It was much worse back then with most of my obsessions revolving around religion. Bear in mind, this was almost ten years ago so of course I don\u2019t remember everything from back then, but most time I had to do things or I was gonna go to Hell when I died or God was going to punish me in some way.\n\nTry to look at this from a ten-year-old\u2019s perspective; it was pretty damn terrifying. I had no idea why I was thinking these things, which just made it that much worse. I truly thought I was a freak and would probably be locked up in a nuthouse if I ever told anyone, so I didn\u2019t. I kept it to myself.\n\nThings continued on like that for about three years and I\u2019d sort of gotten used to it and had just accepted it. I always had these thoughts and I always did what I felt compelled to do, never ignoring them out of fear. Then I decided to Google what I was feeling; that\u2019s when I discovered OCD. I spent *hours* researching and reading and damn it, if I wasn\u2019t doing exactly the things that were being described on these websites.  \n\nI remember the rush of relief I felt to discover I wasn\u2019t alone in this. I still kept it to myself for another four years; I just wasn\u2019t ready to tell anyone yet.\n\nWhen I was seventeen I finally broke down and told my mom about it. I didn\u2019t explain every single thing to her (like the whole going to Hell thing), but I told her the basics. \u201cMy brain tells me I have to do things or something bad will happen.\u201d She didn\u2019t understand it (who would?), but she still tried to be sympathetic. \n\nI guess it didn\u2019t worry her too much, because she didn\u2019t have a whole lot to say about it. I think she was just used to these things; I\u2019d struggled with general anxiety most of my life as well. That was stuff I didn\u2019t have a problem telling her though and I\u2019d been to counseling for it a few times.\n\nFor the past three years since then (I am twenty now if you haven\u2019t done the math), I\u2019d just been sort of dealing with it. Unfortunately, my OCD got worse along with my anxiety and I developed a mild depression. My life was slowly becoming unmanageable and my mom decided it was time for me to get on some medicine.\n\nI still remember the exact date: February 9th. A little over three months ago I made a trip to the doctor, explained everything that was going on, and got started on 25mg of Zoloft. Since then, it\u2019s been increased to 50mg and even though my depression has dissipated, my anxiety and OCD are still here. Yes, they\u2019ve lessened, but they\u2019re still present nonetheless.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve bored you with a lengthy backstory, but I promise there is a point to all of this. \n\nHere lately, all of my obsessions and rituals have been centered around getting hit by a car on my walk to school. I don\u2019t live very far from my university, but I have to cross a somewhat busy intersection everyday to get there. \n\nI don\u2019t remember when this started, all I know is I\u2019ve been complying with it ever since. Don\u2019t tap the refrigerator five times before leaving? Get hit by a car. Don\u2019t brush my teeth in order from back, top, and then front? Get hit by a car. Don\u2019t stare at the outlet for twenty seconds after unplugging my phone? Get hit by a car. \n\nOnce again, yes, I know how irrational it sounds. How the hell could not tapping the refrigerator cause me to get hit by a car on the way to school? I have no idea, but over the past ten years, I\u2019ve learned not to question it. This is my life.\n\nLike I said before, I\u2019ve never ever dared to ignore my thoughts. I\u2019ve always done what I feel compelled to do and went about my merry way.\n\nHowever, this past Monday, I decided I was taking back control of my own mind. I wasn\u2019t going to tap the refrigerator, stare at the outlet, or brush my teeth in the correct order. Instead, that morning I ignored all of the thoughts in my mind and headed to school. \n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering how it was even possible for me to do that but truthfully, inside I was losing my shit. I mean really, I was freaking out, but I was sick and tired of my own brain having so much control over my life. The longer I thought about it, I got more pissed rather than anxious. If this medicine wasn\u2019t gonna help me, I was gonna help myself. \n\nBut when I came to the crosswalk of that really busy intersection, I stopped. All of that fear came rushing back into me and suddenly I realized I needed to go back and complete my rituals like I was supposed to.\n\nI looked down at my phone to check the time and even though I would be late to class, I had to go back. As I turned around, before I could even take my first step, a sharp, white-hot pain shot through my hip, radiating up my side and down my leg. I felt my head hit something hard with a loud \u2018crack\u2019 before my body was propelled through the air. I don\u2019t know how far I flew, but I remember landing on my back with a sickening \u2018thud\u2019 and everything went black.\n\nI woke up a few minutes later in the back of an ambulance. Evidently someone had driven up onto the sidewalk at about 25 miles per hour and struck me. The car took off before anyone could get their plates.\n\nLong story short, I had some x-rays done and found nothing was broken. I was given about twenty stitches where my head hit the windshield, would have some major bruising, and would be sore for a while. \n\nI was released from the hospital and told to come back in another week to have the stitches removed. My parents and I drove home in silence; I was still incredibly shaken up. Thoughts raced through my mind, battling with each other about whether it was just a coincidence or whether I had caused it by not performing my morning procedures. Of course, the logical side of me said \"it absolutely was just a coincidence, there\u2019s no possible way I caused this to happen\", and I tried my hardest to stick with that. \n\nAs soon as I got home, I trudged up to my room, my entire body aching with every step that I took. Thankfully, my brain had quieted down a little and was hopefully going to give me a little bit of peace for a while. I laid my backpack down parallel to my bed with the bottom of it facing my headboard. After adjusting its position until it felt just right, I laid myself down carefully on my bed.\n\nMy head hit my pillow, but something was off; I'd heard a weird crinkling noise. I stayed still for a moment and when I moved my head, I heard it again. It was coming from inside my pillow.\n\nI reached inside my pillowcase and my fingers grasped a piece of paper. As I pulled it out and unfolded it, much to my horror it read:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ignore me next time.\u201d", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d"}, {"score": 123, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/3673mb/the_most_infuriating_thing_about_mlbtv/", "id": "t3_3673mb", "author": "scruffmagee", "title": "The most infuriating thing about MLB.tv", "timecreated": 1431807485.0, "subreddit": "baseball", "selftext": "Getting scoring notifications via the At Bat app before the play happens on MLB.tv", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm7u"}, {"score": 2399, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/HSSRYPB.png", "id": "t3_3655sn", "author": "Pc4LyfeM8", "title": "Steam Cash Giveaway!

But I've never really been a fan of his - I can't put my finger on exactly why but probably a large part of it (as I'm sure is true of most non-Nadal fans) is that I'm a big Roger Federer fan. \nBut last night's match, and his attitude in general over the last month or so, has changed that. We all know that he's not been at his best, and that it's his mental game letting him down perhaps most, but his resolve to go down fighting has been evident in every single point of every single match. He was down a set and two breaks last night and *still* was firing himself up after every good point or winner. There are not many in the game who can boast that. We seem to think of Novak Djokovic as mentally tough - but there have been many times when he has got himself in a rut during a match and faded away mentally. This year's win-loss ratio for Novak would be very different if his opponents had been managed to take advantage of that; Andy Murray in Melbourne, Dolgopolov in Miami and even Federer in Indian Wells (was it 3 double faults Nole hit in that tie-break?!) Nadal's mental game may be letting him down, admittedly, but he's doing EVERYTHING he can on the court to fix that and taking every single point as an opportunity to turn things around. He doesn't stand shouting at his box or smash rackets - he fights. \n\nI'm disappointed in myself that I didn't recognize this about him sooner, and that I'm only now becoming a fan. I sincerely hope he will keep playing as long as he can.

We're getting married in the town where we both lived for several years, so we have a lot of work colleagues and friends in that town who we want to invite. I'm a fairly gregarious, outgoing person, so I have always attracted people and had a lot of friends. Beyond this, we have lived a lot of different places for our graduate work, so we have a wide network of friends. \n\nSo, when I sat down to make the guest list for my side, I divided things by where I knew people from--high school, college, M.A., etc. I thought long and hard about who to invite and how best to honor people who were really important to me at one point in my life, though maybe they were now just part of my larger circle of friends. I had kept my parents informed of the situation and last night sent them the final list I had made, which included 157 to invite for my FH and I, of which many would not be able to come. \n\nI get a call from my mother and she is so frustrated, because now this number suddenly seems shocking to her. She tells me that they are inviting 33 people. She proceeds to lecture me about how having more people will make it more expensive--all things I already know--and that I just have to draw the line somewhere--which makes me upset because I felt as though she thought I was just inviting people willy nilly, not carefully considering who has been important sources of support during my life in it various stages. If I try to to argue I know it will just be worse, so I calmly listen as I hear about how \"the number just keeps inching up and up; you can't invite everyone, etc.\" \n\nIn the end, my parents give me the final number we can invite--which they have the right to tell me, because they are paying for the wedding--and then tell me how many they will invite, to add on how many my FH's family will invite, and then to fit my and my FH's guest list into the remaining number. I'm pretty angry about this because the wedding, which is supposed to be about my FH and I, is now being hemmed in by the friends they want to invite--people who I vaguely remember from growing up, but who I probably could not carry on more than 15 minutes of conversation with. UGH. \n\nSorry for the long post, I mostly just wanted to rant a little bit and blow off steam so that I can be calm and rational when talking to my parents. It's just amazing how wedding planning brings out ALL OF THE OLD ANGST AND DRAMA in your family relations! I already know the arguments that will generate if I try to challenge this or point out the problem here--there's nothing really to do but just make it work, but UGH....IT MAKES ME SO FRUSTRATED! \n\ntl;dr: I have to cut my guest list because my parents want to invite a bunch of their friends\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rv3t"}, {"score": 200, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3672k6/you_get_to_make_all_of_humanity_agree_on_one/", "id": "t3_3672k6", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "You get to make all of humanity agree on one opinion, what is it?", "timecreated": 1431806886.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"score": 12, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/36725m/lineup_for_1st_gfw_house_show_jackson_tn/", "id": "t3_36725m", "author": "hey333", "title": "Lineup for 1st GFW House Show- Jackson, TN", "timecreated": 1431806663.0, "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "selftext": "Tate Twins (Brent and Brandon) v Best Friends (Chuck Taylor/Trent Baretta)\n\nLei\u2019D Tapa v Thea Trinidad\n\nSonjay Dutt v Jamin Olivencia\n\nGeorge T.

I will also present some info about myself below.\n\n**Bio:** \n\nI\u2019m 22 years old and my real name is B\u00e1lint. I\u2019m from Hungary but currently I live in Norway. I always used Nakamura as my online name. My most noteworthy presence was in Age of Mythology\u2019s deathmatch community, where I\u2019ve been a top player since late 2011 and have gotten to the finals of multiple tournaments and held #1 on ladder for prolonged periods.\nMore importantly for this topic though, I have acquired a considerable coaching experience in my time of playing AoM deathmatch. I must have helped hundreds of players improve, always getting very positive feedback. \n\nIn April, I have gotten my master league promotion on EU, and currently I am facing and am doing fairly well against mid-masters.\n\n**Current situation:**\n\nI am working part time as a balance team lead for an unannounced RTS title \u2013 that is all I can say about this, sorry. I also had a job at an E-sport company, but was forced to leave it as they made me wait months for my salaries (in the end it got sorted, with my accepted resignation, aka getting fired).\nTo fill my free time, I have been toying with the idea of coaching in SC2. \n\n**My way of coaching:**\n\nI firmly believe that I can transfer the principles for coaching that I used in AoM. These are the following:\n\n\u2022 I respect the player\u2019s choice of style. I explore using it myself to give quality feedback in case I don\u2019t use it currently. Standard play, while preferred, is not a must, especially not at the non-pro level.\n\n\u2022 Sessions are 3 hours max. Any more and there will be overwhelming information. \n\n\u2022Sessions include replay analysis, live in-game advice(meaning I observe via your perspective and talk to you. this will take an equally skilled practise partner), ZvZ practise with me and other things depending on your individual needs.\n\n\u2022Between sessions I watch your replays by myself to prepare for the next session. Quick tips via in-game chat/skype are free.\n\n\u2022The player doesn\u2019t HAVE to have a microphone, but it\u2019s very much preferred. Voice chat is via skype or the game itself. \nOther services are alright as long as they are free to use.\n\n\u2022You should take notes, but I will send you my own when we\u2019re done.\n\n\u2022Session gets recorded and uploaded unless you mind.\n\n**But at what cost?^TM Details  :**\n\nI am looking to do this on a \"pay what you want\" basis, which means that while by default I am doing this for free, you may tip me if you so choose. I am a very flexible person, and I believe that my editing this section after the comments should prove this.\n\nIt is very possible that the coaching will also cost you your current league border, as I am looking to make a real impact on your gameplay :). Of course I don't feel qualified to coach someone better than myself, which is currently mid-master.\n\nYou can contact me on skype or the game. My Skype username is Nakamura1414 and my EU account is Nakamura #475. I also play on AM occasionally. Nakamura  #474 there. Depending on your individual needs, level and playstyles, I will have to prepare your session accordingly, which may take a day or two.\n\nLooking very much forward to replies and interested Zergs!", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpp6"}, {"score": 262, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/364zcs/pi_the_fourth_wave_part_xxxiii_fo_real_baby/", "id": "t3_364zcs", "author": "semiloki", "title": "[PI] The Fourth Wave: Part XXXIII (Fo' Real, baby!)", "timecreated": 1431751777.0, "subreddit": "HFY", "selftext": "[ALL CHAPTERS](http://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/the_fourth_wave)\n\n[Last Chapter](http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/35rosw/pi_the_fourth_wave_part_xxxiii/)\n\nLight gradually seeped back into the world. With it came sound. Mostly I heard thudding feet and a wet squishing sound that seemed . . . ominous. But there was also something that was almost like a beeping alarm. Except it didn't seem to be coming from my ears. It seemed almost like it was in my head.\n\n*Status . . . .*\n\n*Fractured ribs. Fusion in progress.*\n*Bruising to thoracic spinal area. Repairing.*\n*Combat effectiveness rating: 92%*\n*Administer Booster?*\n\nThe last was a request. My brains were still scrambled from . . .  what had happened to me? It involved gravity. High gravity. Like that remote that Coq used. Coq!\n\nAwareness flooded back to me and I told the armor to *not* administer that berserker drug. The armor had some first aide capabilities. They weren't nearly as extensive as the medical pods in surgery but, then again, if the armor could keep you alive long enough to reach a medical pod they didn't have to be. Considering that the armor was more than capable of marching your unconscious body to a medical facility, that meant that Third Wave soldiers could take a fairly heavy beating and still make it back home. Providing their armor survived the beating.\n\nApparently the crushing gravity had damaged me to the point that the armor had to first repair some of the damage before it judged I was in shape to take that beserker serum. That's good because I didn't really want to. I opened my eyes and found I was laying in the same spot on the hangar floor. Of course, the hangar floor wasn't quite so blue when I was knocked out. Nor sticky. I got the distinct impression that the blue stuff I was looking at had been inside a frog-faced soldier a moment before.\n\nNearby I saw the unconscious forms of Rannolds and Rhymer. They looked hurt. Two slumped over forms just beyond them were probably the engineers. \n\nHalf a rifle clattered to the floor in front of me. The broken end of it had a twisted look to it that suggested it had sheered off while being used as an improvised club. An armored frog crashed to the floor a moment later.  \n\nThe frog's tusks had been snapped off at the gum line and stabbed through the chest plate of the things armor. A rife shaped dent in the alien's lifeless skull left me doubting if the ship's medical facilities could put Humpty Dumpty back together again. How long had I been out? I checked my armor's chronometer and converted it to human units.\n\nTen seconds? That's it? I scrambled awkwardly to my feet and stumbled around the corner of the ship to where the meaty squishing sounds I had heard a moment before originated.\n\nThere were about seven of the frogs left now. All of them were injured. Coq lay on the floor. His high gravity remote a mass of twisted plastic and metal that lay scattered around the pulpy mass of his hand. Coq was breathing but the dazed look suggested he was no longer fully aware of what had happened. I look like his fist had been forced to crush the remote until it exploded in his hand. Had Lee done that? Wait. Why was I even asking that?\n\nI looked back at the seven - no, make that six - frogs that were still standing.  Those that could still hold their rifles were trying to hit a blur of pure mayhem.\n\nIf the blur got too close to them, Lee began a living flail. Arms, legs, or even his head. He struck with all of them in rapid succession until his opponent was a blooded wreck. If they tried to keep him at a distance, Lee shot them instead. It was debatable which was worse. \n\nTwo frogs tried to pin him down against the side of one of the shuttle craft by firing their rifles in his general direction and herding him. Lee ran up the side of the ship and kicked off. He became a human torpedo and slammed into to gut of one of the frogs. Human and frog slumped to the floor in a tangle of armored limbs while energy blasts shot out to the sides. The frog's went wild as it pulled the trigger of its gun reflexively. It managed to shoot the leg of a teammate. Lee's were more controlled. He shot two frogs center mass.\n\nThree remained standing though one of them was now leaning on a shuttle craft for support. Lee brought his pistol back around and shoved the barrel into the mouth of the alien beneath him. The tusks flew outwards from a meaty blue cloud of mist. \n\nThree left. \n\nI cleared my throat and tried speaking.\n\n\"Dire!\" I croaked, \"Intruder alert!\"\n\nGuns popped out of the ceiling and floor and trained on the three attackers. The odds were bad before. Lee had already taken out seventeen of them in just a few seconds. At the sound of my voice they looked at me and I could feel the wave of terror flowing out from them. For all they knew I was just as much of a human blender as Lee was. The site of the guns erupting all around them just compounded what they already secretly suspected.\n\nThey were not leaving this hangar alive.\n\nThey tried anyway. One swung his gun towards Lee and fired repeatedly. One bolt seemed to have actually hit. Lee shrugged it off. Human physiology and its resistance to energy weapons plus the armors own dampeners kept it from actually killing him. It probably should have hurt, but Lee seemed to be in a headspace beyond pain. \n\nThe rifle exploded from the shooter's hands. No. Wait. It didn't. The hands were still attached. How had he done that? The frog let out a throaty scream and was silenced by his own rifle being shoved down his throat. Lee didn't pull the trigger this time. No, he set the powerpack to overload.\n\nNow there were two.\n\nThe two remaining frogs looked at each other and tossed their guns on the floor in a clear sign of surrender. Unfortunately, Lee didn't understand sign language at the moment.\n\n\"Dire!\" I shouted as I saw the Lee shaped blur angle to intercept the two surrendering frogs, \"If you can lock down his armor do it now!\"\n\nDire may have answered my command verbally but I don't really know. I saw the results regardless. Lee's legs locked mid stride and his armor became a full body restraint. Inertia carried him forward and he toppled towards one of the frogs. The frog tried to step out of the way. Too late. \n\nLee's body was frozen. His jaw? Not so much. Somehow he managed to twist around enough to bite into the creature's neck as he fell past it. Gravity and momentum did the rest.\n\nThere was a tearing sound as a large chunk of the frog's neck ripped free. A geyser of blue blood rushed from the wound in an arc. The frog had a moment for surprise to register before its legs gave out and it collapsed on the floor.\n\nOnly one soldier remained standing.  It kept its hands firmly away from any weapons as it locked eyes with me. I got the impression that the inside of its armor was a puddle of urine right now. Its boots would probably slosh as it walked, I mused.\n\nLee snarled defiantly from the floor.\n\n\"Dire?\" I said, \"Can you get Lee to surgery?\"\n\n\"Affirmative, Captain.\"\n\nLee's body jerked upright. Lee howled in rage as he marched stiffly towards the lift.\n\n\"What can we do about getting the survivors to the brig and, um, disposing of the others?\" I asked.\n\n\"Bio hazard automatons have been deployed, Captain,\" the ship replied, \"Would you like me to escort the prisoners to the brig with a training robot?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said nodding, \"I think that will get the message across. Do it.\"\n\n\"Affirmative,\" the ship replied.  A moment later the doors on a different lift opened and Dalek thing rolled out with blades spinning. The ship's guns remained focused on Coq and the frog. They got the hint. The frog grabbed Coq off the floor and hoisted him up on his feet. They shuffled towards the waiting lift with the saw blade wielding training robot hot on their heels.\n\nI was about to ask for something to carry the four Spherians who had come with us to take them to surgery as well but, for once, Dire had actually anticipated my orders. A lift door opened and four hovering sleds flew into the room and dropped next to the homonids. I realized that as they were, more or less, human Dire probably assumed they were part of the crew. Or, at the very least, new recruits. That made some things easier.\n\nI waited for the sleds to carry off the wounded before interrogating the ship.\n\n\"How did they get in here, Dire?\" I asked the air.\n\n\"Please restate the question, Captain,\" the ship answered.\n\n\"They were waiting for us in the hangar,\" I said, \"How did you let that happen?\"\n\n\"The hangar was not specified as a place you wished me to actively monitor,\" the ship pointed out.\n\nI sighed.\n\n\"But when the doors opened you didn't think to look?\" I asked.\n\n\"The doors have not been opened prior to your arrival,\" the ship answered.\n\nI tapped my foot against the floor.\n\n\"There seems to be some evidence that it did,\" I countered.\n\n\"Checking now, Captain,\" the ship answered without a hint of emotion, \"Confirmed. There has been a modification made to the hangar doors to bypass my systems. Repairs have been initiated.\"\n\nI felt my throat go dry.\n\n\"Someone sabotaged the doors?\" I asked.\n\n\"Verified,\" the ship answered, \"Modification appears to originate from the time of system lockdown.\"\n\nI relaxed a bit. Not my crew after all. Then I tensed up again and mentally kicked myself. I'm such an idiot sometimes. The ship had been used as a museum for centuries. Of course they had a way to open the hangar doors without notifying the ship.  \n\n\"Dire,\" I said, \"Perform whatever diagnostics you need to do to seek out any other potential modifications to your designs.\"\n\n\"Warning. Full diagnostics will impair functioning of the ship as various systems are taken off line.\"\n\n\"Will life support be one of them?\" I asked.\n\n\"Negative,\" she ship said, \"Navigation and weapons will be compromised during full scanning.\"\n\n\"For how long?\" I asked.\n\n\"Full diagnostics will take fourteen Earth days.\"\n\n\"Do it,\" I ordered, \"Just make sure the prisoners can't escape during that time.\"\n\n\"Confirmed,\" the ship said, \"Internal security will not be affected.\"\n\nI relaxed once more.\n\nHaving your own personal moon sized battleship may not be every boy's dream but I was actually growing rather fond of the thing. \n\nThe biohazard/sanitation automatons burst into the room then and began going to work on the hangar floor. Each automaton was about the size of a St. Bernard and looked like a giant orange army helmet. One oozed a purple foam onto the floor and began scrubbing up the blue sludge. Another opened a slit and stuck out something that looked like a chainsaw but glowed white with heat. It angled towards the bodies and I decided I didn't need to watch the rest. \n\nI headed towards the lift and rode it to the armory.\n\nBy the time the heavy transport was less than an hour away Dire alerted me to the fact that Lee had been patched up and could be released from his medical pod. \n\nI put the pistol I had been inspecting back into the charging bay and stretched. I felt some kinks pop in my back. Getting out of the armor felt good. Not that wearing it was that bad. After awhile it became like a second skin. Having said that, I was still fond of my first one. \n\n\"Did you do like I asked?\" I queried the ship.\n\n\"Affirmative, Captain,\" Dire answered readily enough. I nodded and left the armory without further comment. I wasn't ready for this but it looked like I wouldn't get a better opportunity.\n\nFour medical pods were still occupied. Dire had agreed with my request to keep them unconscious even after they healed. That, at least, solved the problem of having them wandering around the ship until I had the resources to deal with it. Which should be in an hour or so after I dealt with one little problem area.\n\nThe last occupied medical pod opened as I approached. I had Dire leave a pair of pants on top of one of the cabinets in the surgery. I grabbed them now and wadded them into a ball. I tossed it inside the medical pod without looking.\n\n\"Put those one,\" I ordered, \"Can't stand talking to a man when he's got frank and beans spilling off his lap.\"\n\nThere was a groan from inside and then the sounds of movement. I decided I may as well start talking while he was getting dressed.\n\n\"Bet your head feels great right about now,\" I said, \"The after effects of that stuff is pretty nasty.\"\n\nA groan.\n\n\"Fortunately,\" I said, \"You didn't get as high of a dose as I did. Nor was it mixed with whatever else Dire gave me. Yeah, you're probably doing a lot better than I was. Still, can't imagine you feel this is the time to be on the receiving end of a lecture.\"\n\nLee stood up and climbed wearily out of the pod.\n\n\"Jason if this is about-\" he began.\n\n\"This is about,\" I said, \"You openly challenging me every time I ask you to do something. I don't mind explaining things to you, but there is a time and a place for everything. I don't want to spend the rest of my time looking over my shoulder wondering if you're going to actually slug me this time because I asked you to do something you didn't agree with. Do you want command of the ship?\"\n\n\"No!\" he said with such vehemence it surprised me. I almost lost the thread of my conversation. I forced myself to continue anyway.\n\n\"Too bad,\" I said, \"Because it seems one of us has to be the leader and if you don't want to step up that leaves me. Which sucks for me as you don't seem to want to follow either.\"\n\nHe's eyes narrowed and his lips tightened, but his voice was still even and measured when he spoke up.\n\n\"Jason,\" he said, \"Let's just drop it and-\"\n\n\"What,\" I interrupted, \"Would they do to you in the military if you had threatened a commanding officer like you did to me on the *All is Serene?*\"\n\nHis face grew even darker.\n\n\"This isn't the military,\" he said, \"And you're only the captain because we let you be!\"\n\nThere it was. \n\n\"Should have thought of that before,\" I said, \"Long way to walk back home.\"\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"Fine, Jason,\" he said, anger seeping into his voice now, \"You've had your moment. Don't make Golden Boy feel bad about his decisions or he might cry. Message received.\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" I said with a shrug, \"But I don't expect much from a junkie like you.\"\n\nThat did it. He launched himself at me eyes blazing. A few months ago I'd have been a goner. But that was before I had subjected myself to Dire's teaching methods. I was not in Lee's league at all. But I was no slouch either. I twisted to the side and shoved him as he went past. My push combined with his own momentum accelerated him into the wall behind me. He bounced off and came around swinging. Fortunately I wasn't standing there any more. I had backed up to the other side of the room. He came at me again. I dodged again.\n\n\"Running away, Jason?\" he taunted angrily, \"Is that all you're going to do?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"Five.\"\n\nHe balled his fists and feinted a punch in my direction. I started to side step it before I caught sight of him shifting his weight to one leg. I just narrowly avoided the kick that lashed out in my direction.\n\n\"Careful not to tip over your walker, old man,\" I said, \"Four.\"\n\nHe bared his teeth and charged me once more. I ducked low and to the side. He almost caught me again but once more I slipped away just outside his grasp.\n\n\"Three!\" I said.\n\nHe shifted his weight to his lead foot and held his fists close to his bare chest. He wasn't even sweating and his breathing was only slightly fast. I was already out of breath.\n\n\"What is with all that stupid counting?\" He asked.\n\n\"Two!\" I answered.\n\nHe shook his head and took a step towards me. His knees turned to rubber and he flopped limply to the ground.\n\n\"Crap,\" I muttered, \"My timing was off. That would have been real impressive if I was at zero.\"\n\n\"Drugged!\" he mumbled from the floor, \"You had the ship drug me while I was in the medical pod! You cheated!\"\n\nHis words were muffled from laying face down. I slumped to the floor next to him and rolled him over on his back.\n\n\"Damn right I did,\" I said, \"And don't think I won't do it again. You must think I'm crazy if you think I'm just going to stand there and let you kill me.\"\n\nHe groaned and closed his eyes.\n\n\"What is this stuff?\" he asked.\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\"Kind of a paralyzing agent,\" I said, \"Dire said it will block your ability to use your arms and legs until I administer the antidote.\"\n\n\"When do you plan to do that?\" he asked suspiciously.\n\n\"Good question,\" I said, \"Better question is if I should tell the others that you died in our little ambush in the hangar. Armory is just around the corner, you know. I can be back before you can say 'boo.'\"\n\nHe sighed. He no longer looked angry. Just tired.\n\n\"What is this about, Jason?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"I told you what this is about,\" I said, \"It's about you questioning my every move. I may not be military and, yeah, I've been screwing up from time to time. But, damnit, I'm trying. Why won't you give me a bit of space to breathe?\"\n\nHe snorted. I prepared myself for another angry tirade. Instead he chuckled.\n\n\"You doped me while I was healing?\" he asked with a laugh, \"That's a good one. You're sneaky, Jason.\"\n\n\"Uh, thank you?\" I hazarded.\n\nSuddenly his face darkened again. The mirth died on his lips and he looked incredibly sad.\n\n\"What happened to you, Lee?\" I asked, \"Ordinarily I'd be okay with you having your secrets but things are going to get bad for us soon and I need to know we can depend on you. So, tell me. What happened and why do I seem to set you off?\"\n\nHe scowled and I thought he was going to refuse to answer. To my surprise he replied with only a brief hesitation.\n\n\"You know what I like most about you, Jason?\" he asked me suddenly, \"You're a natural born leader. When things are at their worst you are at your best. You step up when there is a crisis and keep your cool. You do whatever it takes to win and you don't demand anything from your people that you don't demand of yourself. Probably less. Yeah. But you know what I hate most about you? That you're a natural born leader.\"\n\nI was about to ask him when I had done any of the stuff he described. I seem to recall panicking and playing things, largely unsuccessfully, by ear. When had I ever been cool under pressure? But then the last sentence caught my notice.\n\n\"Huh?\" I asked.\n\n\"It wasn't that long ago,\" he went on, \"I used to think of myself the same way. A natural leader. Thought if there was a challenge I'd rise up to it and come out on top somehow.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he replied, \"I got my chance and I screwed it up. Big time.\"\n\nI was still puzzled.\n\n\"I don't understand. I've been screwing up all over the place too. What's the big deal?\"\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"A kid didn't die because of your screw ups, okay?\" he said, \"I got a chance to lead and I made some bad calls. A kid got killed.\"\n\n\"What sort of bad calls?\" I asked.\n\nNow he clammed up. His face darkened and he looked away.\n\n\"Real bad ones,\" he said. He lapsed into silence for a moment more before resuming his narrative.\n\n\"The brass did a formal investigation,\" he said, \"Said it wasn't my fault. I got to walk without so much as a slap on the wrist. But, I don't know. How do you deal with such a thing? I didn't really trust myself after that. Felt the pressure. Started to drink so I wouldn't feel the pressure. When that wasn't enough I did other things. I kept it hidden as best I could but the brass saw I was getting sloppy. I wasn't booted out but when my time was up I was strongly encouraged not to come back.\"\n\nWe both lapsed into silence this time. I could tell he was leaving stuff out. A lot out. For all I knew he was lying about the details he had shared. But for some reason I didn't think so. It felt right. Bitter. A bit jealous. Scared. Scarred.\n\nLee was an emotional wreck and I reminded him of who he had been before his life turned to shit.\n\n\"Lee,\" I began.\n\n\"You can get the antidote now if you want,\" he interrupted, \"Or shoot me if you don't. I don't care. I think I haven't cared for awhile.\"\n\n\"Lee,\" I said, \"We still need you.\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said, \"I can see why she fawns all over you like that. I thought it was teenage hormones and with you being the only male of her own species within several solar systems who wasn't her surrogate dad.\"\n\nI was caught off guard by the change in topic.\n\n\"Are we talking about Jack?\" I stammered.\n\n\"I don't think that's it, though,\" he went on as if he hadn't heard me, \"I think she just saw it first.\"\n\n\"We're talking about Jack?\" I persisted, \"Teenage girl with a switchblade? Likes to lurk and scowl?\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"You'll do whatever it takes to win,\" he went on, \"Follow you and we don't have much of a chance of making it. Don't follow you and we have no chance. Hell, I'm not sure I could take you out if I wanted.\"\n\n\"Jack!\" I said again, \"Prepubescent homicidal maniac. You're saying she has a crush on me?\"\n\n\"If I tried to attack you,\" Lee continued, still refusing to answer my questions in that infuriating way, \"You've probably left Dire instructions to blow up my armor or something.\"\n\nJust stop his heart, actually. I didn't want the shrapnel to hurt any innocent bystanders. Still, he was ignoring the important thing here.\n\n\"Our Jack,\" I repeated, \"She's gone all doe eyed over me? You can't be serious.\"\n\nHe shut his eyes, smile broadening.\n\n\"When do the others get here?\" he asked.\n\nI blinked and considered how much time had passed.\n\n\"Half an hour, I think,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"You had better decide fast what to do with me. Things are going to get awkward soon.\"\n\nI reached for the table where the hypo with the antidote sat. It hadn't even been disturbed when we were thrashing about. Careful planning or dumb luck, Jason?\n\nI held it near his neck but didn't administer it.\n\n\"Are you going to attack me if I give you this?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he said without a trace of irony, \"I will not.\"\n\nI still hesitated.\n\n\"No more challenging me?\" I asked.\n\nHe looked at me.\n\nI gave in a little.\n\n\"In public,\" I amended.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he said, \"I think it would be . . . unwise to distract you.\"\n\nI snorted and administered the injection. He was up and moving within minutes.\n\n\"I'd better get dressed before they get here,\" he said, \"Have you had a chance to find out if you can shut down their armor if we need to?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"Dire is reprogramming the units now. But, listen, about Jack-\"\n\nHe held up a hand palm outwards to me.\n\n\"I wouldn't *dream* of standing in the way of true love, sir,\" he said and then walked off without another word.\n\nGoddamn it, Lee!\n\nI stormed out of surgery and rode the lift up to the hangar.  The floor was spotless now and, other than the addition of a fighter that hadn't been there before, there was no trace of the attempted boarding party.\n\nThe heavy shuttle entered the hangar a moment later. As its landing struts extended I belatedly remembered something.\n\n\"Dire!\" I shouted, \"Do you have some sort of equipment to take photographs?\"\n\n\"Define 'photographs,' Captain.\"\n\n\"Pictures!\" I said.\n\n\"Affirmative.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"I want pictures of the faces of our guests when those doors open.\"\n\n\"Affirmative, Captain.\"\n\nThe door opened on the craft and the three female members of my crew led the charge outside. To my horror, Jack really did give me a shy wave before she stepped to one side of the ramp and glared back inside with her hand hovering near her pistol. The remaining members of the Sperians exited the ship and openly gawked at what they saw.\n\n\"Images captured, Captain,\" Dire said, \"What do you wish me to do with them?\"\n\n\"Print them off and send them to my cabin,\" I said, \"I want to admire them later.\"\n\nThen, to the assembled homonids, I clapped my hands and walked forward smiling.\n\n\"Welcome to the Dire Blade, good people,\" I said with a smile, \"Now we begin the fun stuff.\"\n\n[Next Chapter](http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3686as/pi_the_fourth_wave_part_xxxiv/)", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y95n"}, {"score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/366uns/is_it_worth_buying/", "id": "t3_366uns", "author": "PrestigeEagle", "title": "Is it worth buying?", "timecreated": 1431802610.0, "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "selftext": "I'm thinking about getting the game but want to know if it's worth the crazy price tag. \u00a340 on steam or \u00a335 on G2A just seems way too much for me and from what I've seen so far it doesn't really look like there is much to do.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60"}, {"score": 18, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3673ls/which_young_duo_has_the_best_potential/", "id": "t3_3673ls", "author": "black_asian", "title": "Which young duo has the best potential?", "timecreated": 1431807476.0, "subreddit": "nba", "selftext": "Who is on your top 5 list?\n\nJabari/Giannis?

The original herobound was practically guaranteed to overheat your phone and give you the warning. Using just faceplate and backplate off, I only got the overheat warning once, and I'd been using the phone heavily before playing. That happened at 25 mins into the game. However, after that initial play, I have played twice more at well over an hour each session.

I'm currently waiting for a return flight from a conference, and I thought this might be a neat place to share some impressions I had from my first time attending the Association for Research in Vision and Opthamology annual meeting.\n\nAfter a 5 year journey with crippling back pain on and off (age 25-30), and 5 doctors who told me this was my fault for not exercising enough, I've recently found out I have HLA-B27+ undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy. I was able to see a rheumatologist because I patiently waited for a job in which I could pony up for a PPO plan and not have to try to convince a primary care doctors of anything. I even saw two orthopedic specialists who saw that my SI joints were \"fuzzy\" but thought it was nothing. I found a recommended doctor from spondylitis.org. I told him I was a scientist, and he started talking to me like a colleague. He reads medical literature. I hope he never retires. I want to buy him dinner even though he is >40 years my senior.\n\nRecently in my career I moved to the microbial keratitis field (infections of the cornea, often associated with contact lens wear in developed countries). I recently attended this meeting for eye researchers and clinicians, and I have never seen such an amazing group of people who actually know what HLA-B27 is--largely since it is associated with uveitis.\n\nThe most amazing moment was the closing keynote: Ian Crozier, an MD from the WHO who worked in Western Africa and contracted Ebola, talked about his recovery (this included the discovery of the virus inside his eye long after his blood was negative for Ebola). He commented on the development of SI joint arthritis during his recovery, and made a joke to the effect of: the pain was so bad he thought he would start testing positive for HLA-B27.\n\nThere is a group of researchers and clinicians who actually know about this! But they work on eyes.\n\nI asked my rheumatologist the last time I saw him why so many doctors miss this. He told me, at least when he trained, you had no exposure to rheumatology unless you decided to do a rotation in it. While I hope that's changed, a friend of mine told me after completing her MD coursework that they never discussed HLA-B27, AS, and related conditions--let alone how to use HLA-B27 as a piece of information, not a diagnostic. \n\nHe mentioned it was unfortunate, because inflammatory back pain is easier to treat than mechanical pain. I had never thought of it this way before. I know it's hard to feel that way from our perspective, but there are no drugs to modulate the disease state when you have an injury to the spine--you just have painkillers and surgeries with far-from-guaranteed outcomes. As for me, well, my disease has been managed by sulfasalazine and meloxicam so far. I hope it stays that way, so I can continue to safely work with pathogenic bacteria in the lab.\n\nI'm now in a position to learn much more about immunology. I look forward to incorporating that into my research in the future--perhaps even to my own benefit.

Sounds like you're having a tough time max. That sucks. I've been there, so I kinda know what you're talking about. I've been in the ever circling vortex of self doubt, frustration, and loathing. It's no bueno. I know. If you don't mind lemme tell you a couple things. You can read em if you want, read em again later if you feel like it. But honestly man, if I spend all this time typing this out to you and you don't let it be a little tinder for your fire, well, you're just letting us both down. And you don't HAVE to do that. You don't HAVE to do anything. But you get to choose.\n\n> (Who am I? My name\u2019s Ryan and I live in Canada. Just moved to a new city for a dream job that I got because of the rules below. I owe a lot of my success to people much cooler, kinder, more loving and greater than me. When I get the chance to maybe let a little bit of help out, it\u2019s a way of thanking them. )\n\n> * Rule numero uno - There are no more zero days. What's a zero day? A zero day is when you don't do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I'm not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that's not the point. The point I'm trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system. Didnt' do anything all fucking day and it's 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One pushup. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero. You feel me? When you're in the super vortex of being bummed your pattern of behaviour is keeping the vortex goin, that's what you're used to. Turning into productivity ultimate master of the universe doesn't happen from the vortex. It happens from a massive string of CONSISTENT NON ZEROS. That's rule number one. Do not forget.\n\n> * La deuxieme regle - yeah i learnt french. its a canadian thing. please excuse the lack of accent graves, but lemme get into rule number 2. BE GRATEFUL TO THE 3 YOU'S. Uh what? 3 me's? That sounds like mumbo jumbo bullshit. News flash, there are three you's homeslice. There's the past you, the present you, and the future you. If you wanna love someone and have someone love you back, you gotta learn to love yourself, and the 3 you's are the key. Be GRATEFUL to the past you for the positive things you've done. And do favours for the future you like you would for your best bro. Feeling like shit today? Stop a second, think of a good decision you made yesterday. Salad and tuna instead of Big Mac? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Was yesterday a nonzero day because you wrote 200 words (hey, that's all you could muster)? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Saved up some coin over time to buy that sweet thing you wanted? THANK YOU. Second part of the 3 me's is you gotta do your future self a favour, just like you would for your best fucking friend (no best friend? you do now. You got 2. It's future and past you). Tired as hell and can't get off reddit/videogames/interwebs? fuck you present self, this one's for future me, i'm gonna rock out p90x Ab Ripper X for 17 minutes. I'm doing this one for future me. Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfy? fuck you present self, this one's for my best friend, the future me. I'm up and going for a 5 km run (or 25 meter run, it's gotta be non zero). MAKE SURE YOU THANK YOUR OLD SELF for rocking out at the end of every.single.thing. that makes your life better. The cycle of doing something for someone else (future you) and thanking someone for the good in your life (past you) is key to building gratitude and productivity. Do not doubt me. Over time you should spread the gratitude to others who help you on your path.\n\n> * Rule number 3- don't worry i'm gonna too long didnt' read this bad boy at the bottom (get a pencil and piece of paper to write it down. seriously. you physically need to scratch marks on paper) FORGIVE YOURSELF. I mean it. Maybe you got all the know-how, money, ability, strength and talent to do whatever is you wanna do. But lets say you still didn't do it. Now you're giving yourself shit for not doing what you need to, to be who you want to. Heads up champion, being dissapointed in yourself causes you to be less productive. Tried your best to have a nonzero day yesterday and it failed? so what. I forgive you previous self. I forgive you. But today? Today is a nonzero masterpiece to the best of my ability for future self. This one's for you future homes. Forgiveness man, use it. I forgive you. Say it out loud.\n\n> * Last rule. Rule number 4, is the easiest and its three words. exercise and books. that's it. Pretty standard advice but when you exercise daily you actually get smarter. when you exercise you get high from endorphins (thanks body). when you exercise you clear your mind. when you exercise you are doing your future self a huge favour. Exercise is a leg on a three legged stool. Feel me? As for books, almost every fucking thing we've all ever thought of, or felt, or gone through, or wanted, or wanted to know how to do, or whatever, has been figured out by someone else. Get some books max. Post to reddit about not caring about yourself? Good first step! (nonzero day, thanks younger me for typing it out) You know what else you could do? Read 7 habits of highly successful people. Read \"emotional intelligence\". Read \"From good to great\". Read \u201cthinking fast and slow\u201d. Read books that will help you understand. Read the bodyweight fitness reddit and incorporate it into your workouts. (how's them pullups coming?) Reading is the fucking warp whistle from Super Mario 3. It gets you to the next level that much faster.\nThat\u2019s about it man. There\u2019s so much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days, but that\u2019s not your mission right now. Your mission is nonzero and forgiveness and favours. You got 36 essays due in 24 minutes and its impossible to pull off? Your past self let you down big time, but hey\u2026 I forgive you. Do as much as you can in those 24 minutes and then move on.\n\n> I hope I helped a little bit max. I could write about this forever, but I promised myself I would go do a 15 minute run while listening to A. Skillz Beats Working Vol. 3. Gotta jet. One last piece of advice though. Regardless of whether or not reading this for the first time helps make your day better, if you wake up tomorrow, and you can\u2019t remember the 4 rules I just laid out, please, please. Read this again.\n\n> Have an awesome fucking day \u263a\n\n> tldr; 1. Nonzero days as much as you can. 2. The three you\u2019s, gratitude and favours. 3. Forgiveness 4. Exercise and books (which is a sneaky way of saying self improvement, both physical, emotional and mental)\n\n> Edit: Wow reddit gold? Thanks! No idea what to do with it or whats the deal but many thanks!\n\n> Edit2: Someone asked what I meant by \"much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days\". The long and short of it is a simple truth, but it's tough to TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE. It's this: you become what you think. This doesnt mean if I think of a tree, I'll be oakin' it by august. It means that the WAY you think, the THINGS you think of, and the IDEAS YOU HOLD IN YOUR MIND defines the sum total that is you. You procrastinate all the time and got fear and worry goin on for something? You are becoming a procrastinator. You keep thinking about how much you want to run that 5 k race in the spring and finish a champion? Are ya keeping it in mind all the time? Is it something that is defining your ACTIONS and influencing you DECISIONS? If it is, then you're becoming the champion you're dreaming about. Dreaming about it makes it. Think and it shall be. But do not forget that action is thought's son. Thoughts without actions are nothing. Have faith in whatever it is you've steeled your mind to. Have faith and follow through with action.\n\n> Ok, Ryan that's a bunch of nice words n shit, but how does that help me turn slightly nonzero days into hugely nonzero days. Do you believe all these words you just read? Does it makes sense to you that you BECOME WHAT YOU THINK OF? Ask yourself: What do I think of? When you get home and walk in the door. (how quickly did you turn that laptop on? Did turning it on make you closer to your dreams? What would?) At the bus stop. Lunch break. What direction are you focusing your intentions on? If you're like I was a few years ago, the answer was either No direction, or whatever caught my eye at the moment. But no stress, forgive yourself. You know the truth now. And knowing the truth means you can watch your habits, read books on how you think and act, and finally start changing your behaviour. Heres an example: Feeling like bunk cause you had zero days or barely nonzero days? THINK ABOUT WHAT YOURE DOING. and change just a little bit more. in whatever positive direction you are choosing to go.\n\n> Edit3: WHOA! This blew up!

So, for this past week, I switched out my scout from [my old cosmetic loadout](http://i.imgur.com/QwsVUWw.png) to a [significantly more glorious one](http://i.imgur.com/JLpnxlV.png), and jumped on public servers. Immediately I noticed significant changes. This includes:\n***\n* **Well dressed players immediately attemped to cheese me with melee or secondary,** leading to free kills.\n\n* **Other players engaging in battle with me significantly more often.** I found myself getting a lot more kills, a lot more deaths, and actually running out of ammo very frequently. It seems that people assume they can pick off a gibus scout on the way back to a health kit.\n\n* **In a group fight, I was rarely the center of focus unless I fired first.** In some cases, I have had an unusual-wearing opponent flat out ignore a ~50 damage meatshot to his back once he saw it was a gibus scout. He did not live very much longer.\n\n* **I became treated like a Medic's last priority.** Yes, I know I am a scout, but even if I have 10 health after killing three enemies in front of a Medic, sometimes he won't even heal me to full, if at all.\n\n* **Enemies ran away from fights a lot less than usual.** Once I get a few shots on a player, they usually try to get to a nearby health pack. I found more players ignoring the fact that they had low health just to try to land a few shots on me.\n\n* **A lot more players left after being killed or dominated.** This is a bit of a conclusion to jump to, but it seems that people don't really like getting killed by a player in a gibus.\n\n* **There was a large disparity in how different types of friendly players acted.** More hatless players would treat me normally, by giving me heals, or other assistance. Well dressed players paid less attention, even if my name appears on the scoreboard.\n\n***\n\nSo, the main takeaway is that it is harder to play without having a decked out cosmetic loadout. Enemies will throw themselves at your more, which can be harder to deal with, and you have less assistance from your own team. I suggest to anyone that feels bored on public servers that they stash the unusuals away in the backpack, and they dust off the gibus for a few rounds. It's a pretty different, and fun, way to play.\n\nEDIT 1: I also got successfully vote kicked from a valve server (for cheating), while top scoring.

(I'm not procrastinating, my lunch break is almost over!)\n\nedit1.  Okay, 10 hours later (This did turn into me procrastinating for awhile)\nI've been *talking* about forming a fellowship for this issue for the last 2 years.  I'd talk about it with a few of the people closest to me, they too having this problem, and they agreed that it might be a good idea- but nothing would ever happen.  \nBecause I would never do anything to make it happen.\nOn March 27th I sent a text message to a friend of mine to get contact information for a pastor at a church.  They have a room used for meetings of different kinds and I wanted to see if I could use it.  We exchanged a total of 8 text messages over 3 hours.  8 text messages and I have a phone number for the pastor.  I called and it went to voicemail.  Then it dawns on me that the church has to have website so I Google it.  Of course they do.  I find an email address and hastily type up a short letter explaining what I was trying to do.  It's maybe half of a page.  7 minutes later I receive a reply putting the brakes on because Easter is coming up.  \nI've taken to folding up a single sheet of paper into 8 squares (I'm pretty sure Tim Ferris said he does this, and I thought it was in his blog, and I spent a good 10 minutes searching his blog for it, but I couldn't find it.  I did find something relevant, and posted it right before I started typing this though...) about 2 and a half years ago, and I write little to do lists on it.  I very rarely do everything on them, but they have been instrumental- I mean really important, to me having gotten anything done that was not an absolute *need* in the last two years.  I would normally just forget.  \nAnyway \"Follow up on e-mail\" was on my list every day until April 7th, (because I procrastinated on the 6th) and Sent another follow up, along with the Tools for Recovery.\nI heard nothing for a couple of weeks, and told several different people on several different occasions that I was going to go down to that church in person to ask, but I kept putting it off.  \nApril 29th around noon, he replies with some available times and a requested donation to use the room.  I put off replying for a day- but I wrote it on my list.\nI reply that I'm okay with his terms.  1 hour and 20 minutes goes by, 2 e-mails exchanged, and now I have a time and a place to go.  \nIt was almost 12:00pm, and I wanted to go meet some people somewhere, but the Pastor had informed me the person in the office would only be there until 2pm.  I said I'd try.\nI went back and forth and decided that this really was the most important thing to me at the moment, and went to the church first.  \nA $20.00 deposit for the key, a jotting down of my phone number, and that was it.  I now had a key.\nTurns out the pastor was there on his day off, with his back to me at a computer.  I was introduced by the office person, and I shook his hand saying thank you.  \nThen he asks me:\n\"So, are you going to start tonight?\"\nNow, I hadn't even thought about it.  I wanted to write up some sort of brilliant material combining everything I'd read, and I'd figured that would take a good two weeks.\nI also had forgotten it was Friday.\n\"I replied, well, I guess I could it's best not to put things off.\"\nHis reply was \"That's what it's all about, right?\"\nIt was interesting though, the way he said it was almost like he couldn't remember if that really *was* why I needed it.  I'm pretty sure it was an honest question.\n\"Yes it is\" was my reply, and I walked away.\n\nMy fellow procrastinators were sleeping all day (They're night people, and one had just worked a double)  I finally got ahold of them around 5pm and they agreed to come meet me there at 8pm for our first meeting.\nMost of the material from the original PA website is in some kind of purgatory, but I found it on the way-back machine.  \nI didn't *have* to write anything up, let's just use whats available.  Somethings (a lot of things) don't need to be perfect, they just need to be done.\n\nWe had our first meeting, and it was fine.  We fumbled through some stuff, some things just don't work being read out loud.  \nBut it was a start.\nWe'll be meeting every Friday at 8pm.\n\nSo, what exactly was the point of this?  It's full of run on sentences, my formatting is pretty bad, and my train of thought wanders a bit, (a lot) - and I clearly like parentheses - and I didn't really give you a detailed write up of the meeting, did I?\n\nI guess my point is that I thought about, and talked about something for over two years, (which I won't get back) but did nothing.  No action.  It took a few text messages, a few e-mails, a request for help from someone very likely to give it, $20.00, and I have what I need.  There's no formal agreement.  This was not hard.  It took maybe 2 hours of my time combined over the last 5 weeks.  \nSome things are very difficult, or time consuming, and take hours, weeks months or years.\nI have evidence to suggest getting a place for a group to meet is not one of those things.  If you think you need one, go put one together.\n\nIf you ask me, I'll help if I can.\n\nGood luck!  \n\nStart now.", "subreddit_id": "t5_37kjp"}, {"score": 162, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/35ivig/i_justdont_know_how_you_people_do_it/", "id": "t3_35ivig", "author": "please-halp", "title": "I just...don't know how you people do it.", "timecreated": 1431289624.0, "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "selftext": "I'll start off by saying, I am not from an N family.

She has got to be the most miserable #$%& in existence. Say any little thing wrong, and this...wrath...gets unleashed. If you can't read between the lines, speak her secret language, know all her little unspoken rules, and automatically know what she wants, guess what. You have just fucked up worse than you ever believed possible, and you are going to get chewed out for it.

My boyfriend knew he didn't like how his mother behaves of course, but he didn't have any idea just how bad this really is. I remember him venting his feelings to me before I moved in, saying things like how his mother stresses him out sometimes, blah blah. I thought I understood. Whose mom doesn't occasionally stress them out? The best mom in the world can do that. Little did I know...\n\n\nWhat makes it so unbearable, though, is how everyone in the house facilitates it. They LET her be this way. She throws her outrageous tantrums over, you know, REALLY important things like crumbs by the toaster, or smudges on the face of the microwave. Or us eating Burger King, because it's unhealthy (SHE GAVE US THE COUPONS!! How can she be mad?! Not to mention I eat what I want damn it!) And they all just hang their heads, won't look her in the eye, won't say anything back. It's unreal. She's like the Queen of Hearts, and they're her little card knights running around, doing her bidding.\n\n\nWell, I tried to keep the peace for as long as I could. But, as I knew was only a matter of time, she crossed the line and my sense of self-respect mandated I stand up for myself. So, I told her I wasn't going to listen to this, and that it was ridiculous. Peeps, you should have seen the look on her face. Pure astonishment... It was clear she never in a million years expected anything other than just silent head nodding. Hah well, too bad. I wasn't raised to put up with this shit.\n\n\nAs I walked away, she yelled, \"You bitch!!\"\n\n\nWelp. That about did it for my boyfriend, who immediately lit into her.\n\n\nAnd that's it...we're leaving. In one week. :) I'm so proud of him. I know that being out of this environment is going to be incredible for him.\n\n\nSo kudos to all of you because, this is just a TINY slice of what you've all had to live through.

Posts asking for evolved Pok\u00e9mon will be ignored.**\n\n\nWell, we've finally reached the final installment of my Top 10 type series, but never fear! I've already begun breeding for my Top 10 region series, and have a few others planned for later (Top 10 Megas, and Top 10 Pok\u00e9mon Conquest Warlords for a start). If you have any other ideas for Top 10s (because clearly you people must know my Top 10 everything because I'm such a special snowflake) then let me know in the comments below.\n\n\n\nIt's time to honour the deadly Dragon type! As always with my giveaways, all of these Pok\u00e9mon are 4+ IVs with competitive moves, natures, and abilities. Please consult the GTS guidelines in the sidebar about the kinds of Pok\u00e9mon to upload. Please deposit your Pok\u00e9mon before you comment. Make your message DRAGON so I know you're from this giveaway. Multiple Pok\u00e9mon are allowed. Upload your Pok\u00e9mon before commenting. With that out of the way, let's see who made the list. \n\n\n\n10\\. Goodra\n\n\n\nWill the real Slime Shaddy please stand up!\n\n\n\n| Goomy | Calm | Gooey | None |\n\n\n\n9\\. Noivern\n\n\n\nBadass bat dragon with boom boxears. Enough said. \n\n\n\n| Noibat | Timid | Infiltrator | None |\n\n\n\n8\\. Garchomp\n\n\n\nLandshark. \n\n\n\n| Gible | Jolly | Rough Skin | Iron Head, Outrage |\n\n\n\n7\\. Altaria-M\n\n\n\nOne of my favourite Megas, this fluffy cloud will fuck you up. Cotton candy has never been so dangerous. \n\n\n\n| Swablu | Modest | Natural Cure | Hyper Voice |\n\n\n\n6\\. Dragalge\n\n\n\nPoison/Dragon is such a cool type combination, I was super excited when I heard it was included in XY. I also love it's design and colour scheme. \n\n\n\n| Skrelp | Modest | Adaptability | None |\n\n\n\n5\\. Flygon\n\n\n\nThe original Ground/Dragon. The most requested mega for a reason. This thing is awesome and does not require an explanation.\n\n\n\n| Trapinch | Adamant | Arena Trap | Fissure, Superpower, Feint, Bite |\n\n\n\n4\\. Hydreigon\n\n\n\nFairy-types may fuck this thing up, but it's still hard to deny how badass a three-headed dragon that lurks in the shadows is. For the Targaryen in your life.\n\n\n\n| Deino | Modest | Hustle | Dark Pulse, Earth Power |\n\n\n\n3\\. Tyrantrum\n\n\n\nDo you know how long I've waited for a T-Rex Pok\u00e9mon? Far too long. But now I have a badass Rock/Dragon Type, which is nice.\n\n\n\n| ~~Tyrunt~~ | ~~Jolly~~ | ~~Strong Jaw~~ | ~~Thunder Fang, Ice Fang, Poison Fang, Dragon Dance~~ | \n\n\n\n2\\. Dragonite\n\n\n\nThe original Dragon type. Dragonite walks a fine line between threatening and adorable. A playful adventurer, Dragonite is looking for a good time; perhaps he'll find one with you!\n\n\n\n| ~~Dratini~~ | ~~Jolly~~ | ~~Marvel Scale~~ | ~~Dragon Dance, Extreme Speed~~ | \n\n\n\nAnd my #1 Dragon type is...\n\n\n\n1\\. Charizard X\n\n\n\nI debated whether or not I should even include Charizard X on this list since normal Charizard isn't a dragon type, but no list of Dragon could really be complete without it. Charizard was my first starter and so it will always hold a special place in my heart. \n\n\n\n| Charmander | Jolly | Blaze | Flare Blitz, Dragon Dance |\n\n\n\nAnd those are my Top 10 Dragon types. I'd like to thank all of you once again for participating in this series. In an age of Hacked/Cloned giveaways, it's nice to see some people still prefer to breed/train their own 'mons. Sorry there was a giant hiatus in the middle of the series, I'll try not to let that happen again.

I intended to wait until I'd discussed the best way to end things with my therapist - I'm really bad at these things and she and I still spend a lot of time working on navigating relationships in a healthy way. But he called before I had the opportunity and it didn't go well.\n\nI feel like I have such a hard time making him really hear me. I tell him the things I'm worried about and object to. That I don't want surgery and think he really needs to do some research about it to understand that its not magic. He came back with something about how much safer liposuction is these days and told me I was the one who wanted to be attractive for him. I guess thats true? After I originally admitted that I was lying he wanted to meet and I said no because I was pretty embarrassed about everything. Especially the contrast between what I'd claimed to look like and what I really looked like.\n\nAll of the conversation was like that. I'd tell him my thoughts, he'd tell me why I'm wrong and bring up something I said two years ago that would confirm it. He doesn't get that I've changed since then and its frustrating.\n\nI finally got tired of trying to argue with him. I told him that I was done and I didn't want to continue talking to him about it. And he flipped out on me. He started screaming some of the most hurtful things I've ever heard at me. I just hung up and I didn't answer when he called back. Then I started getting a ton of texts about how much he needs me. Then more abuse. Then silence for a while until I got a text a couple hours ago that he's on his way here and he'll be here tomorrow afternoon.\n\nI've texted him not to come. I've left voicemails. I sent an email. I do not want him to come here. I don't believe anything but more drama will come from it and I hate confrontations and I hate meeting new people and those are all things I'm working on with my therapist but we aren't done yet.\n\nI have no idea what to do when he gets here. I want to get in my car and leave. I can't, because I have two large dogs I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving behind and my roommate isn't in town to feed the fish, but I want to. Am I a bitch if I don't let him in? I'm not worried about my safety or anything. I'm worried I'm going to end up making some concession just to get him to leave or something else along those lines. Something that will drag this out longer. And that I might panic attack myself into a heart attack in the next twelve hours. I know we both need to let this mess go and get on with our lives. How do I make him understand?\n\n**tl;dr** He's driving here from a couple states away. Uninvited and unwanted. How do I not let this get completely fucked up?\n\n**Edit** I'm really hoping he bluffing and isn't on his way here. In case he's not, I phoned my roommate and told him whats up and roommate decided to come home this morning so he should be here within an hour. A couple of my cousins were willing to come hangout for a while so I'm not here alone. And I'm prepared to call the cops if he shows up and won't leave or tries to force his way in.\n\nThanks to everyone who offered advice and encouragement. And those who were pretty blunt about telling me I needed to wake up and see that he's got a lot of potential to cause serious trouble. I had some realizations reading that which probably should have occurred to me a long time ago.\n\nThose of you who think I'm a terrible person and deserve whatever I get... I dunno. I think you're wrong. Theres no denying lying to him was wrong, I'm not trying to defend that. I'm not the same woman I was then. I've done and am doing what I think is appropriate about it. Mainly, working on my body and with my therapist to get myself into a physically and emotionally stable and healthy state. Its not easy, I've got a lot of stuff I need to work out. But I'm doing it.

We've been lucky to take the journey out of the church together. I'm HIGHLY attracted to her--she's a gorgeous woman, she's fit and active. We have 4 kids together, but she looks like she's still 25 years old. For the most part, we are emotionally compatible and close. \n\nBut she has major sexual repression issues. She is painfully private, but especially in regards to sex. She doesn't like me to look at her naked. 75% of the time, she just lays there during sex. Maybe 20% of the time she gets aroused and engaged, and when that happens, it's very satisfying to me, even if a little routine. But I don't complain about it. \n\nThis is not for a lack of me trying. I keep myself in great shape. I show her genuine love and affection. I spend a lot of time on her during sex. She's not an asexual person, but does have a low libido. I think I have merely an average libido. Sex twice a week would be fine with me. I actually feel sorry for her. Her life would be totally fine without sex. I respect that most of the time she's at least trying to accomodate my needs, even though I can tell she's doing it out of compassion, not desire.\n\nBut then something ugly rears its head, like this week. Backstory: almost a year ago, she got tipsy on wine, the passion flared in her eyes, and she tried oral sex on me for the first time. Who was I to argue??? It was fantastic. I forced nothing on her, and she sure seemed to enjoy it at the time.\n\nBut the next morning, she felt \"dirty.\" She blamed me for \"taking advantage of her.\"  It led to a big fight, but we let it go, and things returned to status quo. \n\nThen my son goes through \"Growing and Changing\" class in 6th grade. Parents are supposed to have open and honest discussions with their kids in the evening after the class. That's been going on for a couple of weeks, and those discussions have been fine as long as they deal with anatomy, hormone changes, fetal development, etc.\n\nBut then 3 nights ago, he asks with total innocence, \"What's masturbation? What's pornography? What's oral sex?\"\n\nTalk about a trigger! These questions caught us by surprise. I started to explain matter-of-factly what each of those things is. I feel determined not to start the cycle of shaming that I was subjected to as a young man. \n\nShe jumps in, \"Masturbation is NOT okay for a young boy. It means you're not in control of yourself anymore and it leads to bad thoughts about women,\" and \"Pornography is a crime. Those women are sex slaves forced to do things just so men can make money,\" and the big one, \"Oral sex is dirty and filthy. It is cruel to the woman because it gives her no pleasure, and it can lead to bad diseases in the mouth.\" (She honestly knows NOTHING about any of these subjects beyond what she may have been exposed to as a Mormon youth.)\n\nI tried to correct this misinformation, but didn't want to make a big scene in front of our boy. We left it as, \"It's never okay to do something your partner isn't comfortable with, but it's also not bad to have certain thoughts about women, that's part of growing up.\"\n\nWell, she put me in the deep freeze after that conversation, unwilling to talk about it, not allowing me to touch her. Then yesterday morning, she wakes up angry and summarily tells me she can never trust me again because I forced her to have oral sex a year ago. (Once again, I most definitely did NOT force her.) She says, \"I don't know if I can ever trust you again.\"\n\nThis caused another big blow up. I told her it has nothing to do with oral sex, and everything to do with her using sex as a weapon, refusing to take accountability for her own actions, or to have a mature concept of what healthy adult intimacy can look like. In the end, I believe this is all a projection of her deep-seated insecurity about herself and her sexuality. \n\nUgh. I know many of you will suggest that we should see a marriage counselor and a sex therapist. The problem is that she is so defensive that she won't even consider the possibility that that's necessary or desirable. In the deepest parts of her mind, sex is dirty. Seeing a sex therapist would be like seeing a dirt therapist.\n\nThis won't be a deal breaker. She's a highly hormonal woman, and it's that time of the month. It will probably all blow over in a few days and return to status quo again. \n\nBut I put this out there, because while some exmo husbands may be sexist assholes, many of us just want to have satisfying sexual relationships with the woman we love. We've committed to be monogamous. We've never had sex with another woman. There's no longer a god threatening us with damnation if we have an affair or watch pornography. And yet the woman we've committed to, the only one who can meet our normal male needs, continues the process of shaming/blaming us for our sexuality, and using it as a means to control and punish. \n\nAnd ladies, that's when a man's wife starts to seem more and more like the old ball and chain . . .\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0gj"}, {"score": 1066, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/35i5f4/if_you_google_your_reddit_name_whats_the_first/", "id": "t3_35i5f4", "author": "ICantBeTrusted", "title": "If you Google your Reddit name, what's the first picture you see?", "timecreated": 1431276048.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"score": 10, "url": "https://youtu.be/XTa0_1TmaqU", "id": "t3_35jdh4", "author": "SykkaGaming", "title": "Sometimes I dislike this game, here's why:", "timecreated": 1431299208.0, "subreddit": "MillerPlanetside", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wi6w"}, {"score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgamingtechsupport/comments/35jfpi/ffxiv_arr_streaming_with_obs_shoots_my_cpu_usage/", "id": "t3_35jfpi", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "FFXIV ARR streaming with OBS shoots my CPU usage through the roof!", "timecreated": 1431300403.0, "subreddit": "pcgamingtechsupport", "selftext": "ok im not the best with computers but I get by, so bear with me.\n\nSo as the title says, I play an mmo called final fantasy 14. my specs are gtx 660, amd 8320 8 core, and 8 gb of ram.\n\nso, i compared and with just ffxiv running, my cpu usage is 15-20%. when I start up open broadcast software to stream, it shoots up to 80% cpu usage. seems very significant and im not sure why. i feel like my rig should be able to handle this. anyone have any ideas why its doing this? im too scared to run obs with the game bc I dont want to melt my cpu or anything lol\n\nbtw my settings for the game are not on max. they are on high, but my fps drops with OBS, so I switched to standard settings and my fps no longer drop. it still stays at 80% cpu usage though", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vsoo"}, {"score": 4333, "url": "http://imgur.com/8V3punb", "id": "t3_35iym7", "author": "Zerhvex", "title": "My awesome watermelon flower", "timecreated": 1431291298.0, "subreddit": "food", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh55"}, {"score": 196, "url": "http://imgur.com/ifBgDqN", "id": "t3_356zp2", "author": "dirtyfries", "title": "Spotted in Financial District, anyone know what he's doing?

[](/NYRB) **1-0** [](/NYC)\n\n**9'** Lloyd Sam is tearing up that flank against RJ Allen. You can tell the latter took some time off from soccer.\n\n**11'** The ball went boom. That's something you don't see every day\n\n**15'** NYCFC get the first corner of the game. It wasn't very  good. They don't look like they know what hit them today.\n\n**18'** [](/NYRB) [](/yellow) Miazga booked for a foul just outside the box on Shelton. Hijinks ensue. \n\n**20'** GOAL! Just kidding. Wingert is flagged for offside on the free kick. AR nails it.\n\n**22'**  Kljestan swings a ball in for BWP, but the Ultimate Goal Scoring Machine^TM heads it over\n\n**25'** Great save by Saunders off of Felipe.\n\n**29'** Alvarez decides to have a crack from outside the box. He misses wide.\n\n**31'** Perrinelle swings in a dangerous cross, but nobody is there to receive.\n\n**34'** More dangerous crosses from Red Bulls. Wright-Phillips finds Sam, but after the winger settles, nobody's there to tee up  the shot.\n\n**36'** [](/NYRB) [](/second-yellow) Miazga booked for a foul on Shelton, he's already been booked. He has to make like Michael Jackson and beat it, and Red Bulls are down to 10 men.\n\n**38'** [](/NYRB) [](/sub) Ouimette replaces Grella, allowing the Red Bulls to keep 4 in the back.\n\n**44'** Jacobson takes a shot from outside the box. It's bad. Very bad. NYRB keeping good shape.\n\n***45' One minute of added time***\n\n**45+1'** [](/whistle) BWP nearly tacks on another one, and shortly after, Kelly calls for half.\n\n**HT** [](/NYRB) **1-0** [](/NYC)\n\n**46'** [](/whistle) Half #2 underway! No changes.\n\n**50'** RJ ALLEN ROBS SAM OFF THE LINE!!\n\n**52'** [](/NYRB) [](/goal) **GOAL** It's BWP AGAIN!! Beautiful textbook counterattack. Sam, to Kljestan, to BWP, to the back of the net!! [](/NYRB) **2-0** [](/NYC)\n\n**58'** The South Ward is pointing out that The Third Rail is not singing.\n\n**59'** [](/NYRB) [](/yellow) Lawrence booked for breaking up a NYCFC 3-on-3\n\n**62'** A shoe issue is preventing Kwadwo Poku from entering\n\n**64'** [](/NYC) [](/sub) And he's finally ready. Poku enters for Mix.\n\n**65'** Great save Robles off of Allen!\n\n**66'** EVEN BETTER STOP BY SAUNDERS TO DENY BWP'S HAT TRICK!!\n\n**68'** [](/NYC) [](/sub) Villa off for Mullins. So basically NYCFC has a USL team out there right now.\n\n**70'** [](/NYC) [](/sub) Ballouchy replaces Alvarez\n\n**72'** Mullins fires a bullet from about 20 yards out. Wide.\n\n**75'** Felipe had BWP open in the box, but instead elects to put it into Row K\n\n**76'** [](/NYC) [](/goal) **GOAL** About the only guy not named Saunders to show up for City today, Mullins gets one by Robles. This will be a fascinating last 14 minutes. [](/NYRB) **2-1** [](/NYC)\n\n**78'** [](/NYRB) [](/sub) Loud applause for BWP as he comes off. Dane Richards enters.\n\n**82'** [](/NYC) [](/yellow) RJ Allen booked for a foul on Sam\n\n**85'** Poku threatens, but Ouimette makes a great tackle. \n\n**87'** [](/NYRB) [](/sub) Last sub of the day: Roy Miller for Lloyd Sam\n\n**87'** [](/NYC) [](/yellow) to Poku for something\n\n**88'** [](/NYC) [](/yellow) Foul on the edge of the box gets Ballouchy in the book\n\n***90' Four minutes added time***\n\n**90'** [](/NYRB) [](/yellow) shown to Kljestan\n\n**90+1'** Duvall has a crack, but it's stopped rather easily by Saunders. \n\n**90+3'** Counterattack by NYRB is disrupted by a very  weak offside call\n\n**90+4'** [](/whistle) GAME.

I'm  32, female, mixed race.  But my white parent had his own baggage that mimicked the passive Asian enabler parent in many ways.  Mom is Philipino  immigrant.\n\nParents were very strict, but also inconsistent.  Discipline had to do with what was convenient for the parents, not about teaching proper morals or behaviour to the children (I have a sister).  Very discouraging of having friends, especially as we got older.  Ridiculous expectations about grades, and hypocritical to boot since both parents were C students with high school education.  Despite high expectations of academic acheivement, having a tutor was out of the question, because that would be like admitting that I wasn't smart enough to \"figure it out myself.\"\n\nThey were bad with money, and obsessed with keeping up with the joneses, a terrible combination.  This would ultimately be the key to my freedom and success, but it added a lot of stress before my escape, culminating in a move across the country when I was 11, totally severing ties with my old life and friends, traumatizing me, but a catalyst for a plan.\n\nThe physical abuse only stopped when I was 13 and I kicked my mom as hard as i could in the knee (she was standing above me on the bed wielding a shoe or a stick or something, i think she was mad that I didn't hang my coat up properly), she fell off the bed and had a limp for a few days.  I coldly apologized for her physical pain but explained that the English language was sufficient for a 13 year old to understand a message.  I may have also dared her to call the police on my \"assault\" and explain the context of her injury from her straight A student.  My first victory.\n\nIt took longer to resolve the emotional abuse.  I took a trip to Ottawa in grade 9 or something for some cross-country over-acheiver socialisation program that the school desperately wanted me to go on (I think they kind of had an inkling of my misery and thought this would help cure me of my shyness and withdrawal, which was astute of them).  It was a week, I was quite anxious and didn't make too many lasting friends, but I learned something: that it was possible to leave, and that if at age 14 I could get away for a week, at age 18, I could get away forever.\n\nFrom that point I began to plan my ultimate rebellion: moving out.  Leaving Vancouver.  Making my own life.  I lacked confidence in many subjects, and I really could have used a tutor, so I didn't get perfect grades, but I did well enough to get into any liberal arts programs at any of the top schools in the country.  We had no money in the family, so I got a part time job with a bunch of my friends, and this began the unraveling of the tight control on my social life.  I didn't save a lot of the money, I was drunk with even that tiny bit of freedom, but I learned some stuff about life and work ethic.\n\nI applied to schools in Ontario and Quebec, as well as BC, but had no intention of going to them.  It was just to pull the wool over my parents' eyes.  I ended up at a pretty good school, in a very open-ended program.  This is where my parents foolery with money ended their control:  they couldn't afford for me to attend any post-secondary education, in our province or in any others.  They hadn't saved a penny for me.\n\nSo I plunged into student and credit card debt and moved to Ontario.  I went a little wild in university.  I drank a LOT and discovered weed, but eventually learned moderation for both (pregnant now so don't do either, but occasionally use both when not breeding).  Mom made one last desperate power play in my second year, by refusing to co-sign a loan and tried to get an aunt to finance my education on the condition I transferred back to BC.  My dad was at the end of his life (I didn't know this at the time), and was ready to give up the fight, and he convinced her to just do what I asked.  After my dad passed, he had some life insurance so I actually didn't need money or loans for my final year of school.  I started dating my boyfriend (now husband) at this point.  After graduation we moved to Japan and taught English for 3 years to get a head start on our student debts.\n\nMy mom made another foolish move and sold a large valuable property just when we were ready to move back to Canada and so she couldn't make a convincing argument for us to move to Vancouver.  We move to Toronto where my husband's extremely normal non-abusive white family had a softer landing for us.  Within 3 months of us moving back to Canada we both had decent jobs.  Within one year we were free of student debts and were able to buy a small condo (which we live in to this day).\n\nWe got married at city hall not long afterwards.  We had our first child a few years later and are expecting our second in the fall.\n\nI have a good civil service job, but it's not a super high-powered profession in an Asian Approved field.  My husband works long hours and makes decent money, but we are solidly middle middle class.  We drive a used car.  Once the day care is paid, we don't have a ton of cash left.  But he works in travel and we can take a nice vacation once a year, and we do have some nice things.\n\nMom was hoping my life here would fail.  Not my marriage, as she does genuinely like my husband, but that we would fail here, and need to move to where she is.  She was not pleased when I got the government job, because she knew this meant I would never leave Ontario.  She still resents it a bit, especially now that she can't see her grandkid as often as she would like.  She was unemployed during a prolonged midlife crisis, and we offered to pay her to move here and sit him in lieu of daycare (the same rate we pay the daycare, which is a full rate), but she declined.  She didn't want to do it on our terms.  She wants to see him on her terms.  Sometimes the guilt creeps in but my  rock solid husband is quick to put this in perspective for me.  It would be supremely irresponsible for us to quit perfectly viable careers to relocate to an expensive city with no prospects for immediate employment.\n\nWe get along pretty well now, all things considered, because she is totally disarmed.  She has no hold on me.  I make more than her, my marriage is more stable than hers ever was, and most importantly, I refuse to engage her nonsense when it does rear its head.  It's very easy to end a conversation if I don't like her tone, or to dismiss a topic I think is none of her business.  I would never deny her access to her grandchildren, but she believes I would, and as such, she plays nice now.\n\nEscape was years in the making.  It involved some strict financial discipline and living in basements and buying furniture at Salvation Army and Value Village (to this day).  It involved wearing the same socks for years, and only getting a smart phone in 2013.  It involved on accepting the help of non-blood relatives, and trusting that their motives are different from those of my own blood relatives.  \n\nIt would have played out differently without my husband and his wonderful family who offered their love and financial support simply because they wanted their son to succeed, not because they want to control him.  When I parent my children, although I don't approve of all their approaches, I model more more after what they do than what my parents did.  I would have probably still managed without my mother's support without my in-laws, but it would have been a longer time-frame.  Their support greatly accelerated my financial freedom.\n\nI posted this because I wanted to share with the younger people (and age-peers where applicable), that all is not lost if you don't want to be a lawyer, engineer or doctor.  All is not lost if you don't get straight A's.  All is not lost if you have a few hard, lean years.  That it is okay to lean on a supportive partner (provided you know they are trustworthy and their motives are good).\n\nMy husband and I are planning to take care of my mother through her old age, although she doesn't know this.  We want her to sweat about it since she doesn't have enough money saved.  Because of the healthy distance I have created, I am better prepared to willingly meet this obligation, rather than be guilted into it. \n\nThis isn't possible for all of you because your parents and your journey may yet be more difficult, but those of you who think there is hope for a functional if somewhat distant relationship, there is a way to make it work.\n\nI feel this is probably a wall of text as it is, but if you would like to ask questions about the specifics of the things I have said, please do ask in the comments, and I would love to share.\n\nTL;DR There is hope, don't let them tell you that you will fail without them.

I believe it is not the case.\n\nIt is known that Kabr and his fireteam couldn't beat the Templar because there was no Relic. His teammates were wiped from existence by the Templar. That happened while defending confluxes, they were marked by Fanatics, and negated by the Templar. \n\n> I have made a wound in the Vault. I have pierced it and let in the Light.\n\nI know it was Fanatics because they couldn't be cleansed because the Light Well didn't exist yet, [Kabr made it later](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-603080), and it couldn't be by the Oracles because then Kabr would be marked as well, and he also couldn't cleanse himself. \n\nSo Kabr studied the Vault and the Vex, and he let the light, and [created the Aegis out of himself](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-603080). It is noticeable in that alternate pathway in Trial of Kabr that there are trees and moss, which is likely the place where he \"let the light in\". That place must be somehow bound to the Aegis pedestal, because it is also a light source. What we ended up with is a weapon for future guardians to defeat the Templar. That destroyed him. Did Kabr die, or became a lightless husk, like Eris Morn? Or did he become one of the Vex? Will we encounter him? Did we encounter him somehow already?\n\n\n***EDIT***\n\nIt was pointed out by many that Aegis was made from a Gorgon.\n>From my own Light and from the thinking flesh of the Vex I made a shield.\n\nGorgon is the only correlation I can make to a \"thinking flesh\". Because it is [believed](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/34jbuv/vog_the_templargorgons_and_the_power_of_the_vault/) that Gorgons can both decide what is real and execute it. Unlike oracles, where 2 step process is required.\n\nHow did he get past the Templar? Few good theories, including that [he found a passageway at the spirit bloom chest which was later marked by the Oracles and sealed off because it presents a threat to the Vault.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/35ibrh/my_thoughts_on_kabr_pahanin_and_praedyth/cr4v4p3).\n\nAnother [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/35ibrh/my_thoughts_on_kabr_pahanin_and_praedyth/cr4y58j) by [/u/aidan_316](https://www.reddit.com/user/aidan_316) describes how raid mechanics evolve to respond to Kabrs doings. Excellent contribution! \n\n___\n\n### Pahanin\n\nNow a lot of people on this sub raise the issue of Praedyth and Pahanin, and their relation to Kabr, and were they part of his fireteam. Their names can't be known if they are erased from existence by the Templar. My theory is that they were part of the second fireteam that raided the VoG, and there they encountered Kabr in his last moments, where he gave them the Aegis, so they can use it to beat the Templar, and [curse them if they don't](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-603080)\n\n> And if you abandon your purpose, let the Vault consume you, as it consumed me.\n\n\nWhen they faced Gorgons for the first time, a lot of them got wiped. Pahanin being alive and telling Kabr's story is a clue that we can use The Aegis to cleanse the Gorgon's Gaze. Pahanin lost his shit obviously, witnessing that same is happening to him, as it did to Kabr. Then created SGA to keep himself sane. What really baffles me is how (and why) is he [killed by Dredgen Yor](http://destiny.wikia.com/wiki/Cloak_of_Dredgen_Yor). How their stories intertwine is yet to be discovered. SGA bounty starts on Mars, so its safe to assume Yor killed him there, but Mars isn't mentioned anywhere in Yor grimoire. As the matter of fact, they only [mention Moon](http://destiny-grimoire.info/#Card-302170), and in a sense that it is believed that no one went to the Moon, let alone Mars.\n\n>[u.2:1.0] Been to Luna? \n\n>[u.1:1.4] Excuse me? \n\n>[u.2:1.1] The Moon. You been? \n\n>[u.1:1.5] Nobody's been. \n\n>[u.2:1.2] That a truth? \n\n>[u.1:1.6] That's a fact.\n\n___\n\n### Praedyth\n\nPraedyth is hard to explain. We suppose he wasn't wiped from existence, otherwise we would know his name. But, his name is only left on his guns. He isn't mentioned anywhere else. Not by existing Vanguard, nor by Pahanin. If he was part of his fireteam and wasn't wiped, I would expect at least some reference. It is strange that Pahanin only talks about Kabr once he exits the Vault. But he can't be wiped, because weapon descriptions:\n\n>He skipped like a stone on time's ocean.\n\n>Praedyth's fall isn't over... because it hasn't happened yet... and it will happen again.\n\nIndicating he is still there, trapped inside the Vault's time paradox. Maybe it's referring to all future raid wipes that we are experiencing now. \n\nI am 100% certain Praedyth wasn't in Kabr's fireteam, for several reasons. Firstly, Kabr's fireteam didn't beat the Templar. Praedyth can't be locked out of time before the Gatekeeper encounter. Also, Praedyth's Timepiece drops from Gatekeeper, so he is either left trapped in one of the portals, or reached some depths of VoG that we are still to explore, that vast nothingness after jumping puzzle, before Gatekeeper. I see the \"skipping stones\" reference right there. His Revenge though, drops on Oracles/Templar, so maybe Revenge isn't referencing avenging Praedyth, but that he perhaps avenged Kabr by defeating Templar (pew pew with fast firing sniper). And what better place to snipe the Templar than that high ledge you reach after passing alternate path in Trial of Kabr.\n\n___\n\nAnd one final thought, when someone is wiped from existence, it should naturally change the past as well. But time is immutable and you can only change a copy. So only pasts that were changed are those that are yet to happen. We, guardians, may be one of those new pasts, just recollecting bits and pieces of Vex infused artifacts that are locked out of time.\n\n\n\nFood for thought.\n\n___\n\n***EDIT***\n\nThe response is huge.

RBA shaking already.\n\n**4'** [](/NYRB) [](/goal) **GOAL** A dream start for Red Bulls! And who else? BRADLEY WRIGHT-PHILLIPS! Great cross by Lloyd Sam. [](/NYRB) **1-0** [](/NYC)\n\n**9'** Lloyd Sam is tearing up that flank against RJ Allen. You can tell the latter took some time off from soccer.\n\n**11'** The ball went boom. That's something you don't see every day\n\n**15'** NYCFC get the first corner of the game. It wasn't very  good. They don't look like they know what hit them today.\n\n**18'** [](/NYRB) [](/yellow) Miazga booked for a foul just outside the box on Shelton. Hijinks ensue. \n\n**20'** GOAL! Just kidding. Wingert is flagged for offside on the free kick. AR nails it.\n\n**22'**  Kljestan swings a ball in for BWP, but the Ultimate Goal Scoring Machine^TM heads it over\n\n**25'** Great save by Saunders off of Felipe.\n\n**29'** Alvarez decides to have a crack from outside the box. He misses wide.\n\n**31'** Perrinelle swings in a dangerous cross, but nobody is there to receive.\n\n**34'** More dangerous crosses from Red Bulls. Wright-Phillips finds Sam, but after the winger settles, nobody's there to tee up  the shot.\n\n**36'** [](/NYRB) [](/second-yellow) Miazga booked for a foul on Shelton, he's already been booked. He has to make like Michael Jackson and beat it, and Red Bulls are down to 10 men.\n\n**38'** [](/NYRB) [](/sub) Ouimette replaces Grella, allowing the Red Bulls to keep 4 in the back.\n\n**44'** Jacobson takes a shot from outside the box. It's bad. Very bad. NYRB keeping good shape.\n\n***45' One minute of added time***\n\n**45+1'** [](/whistle) BWP nearly tacks on another one, and shortly after, Kelly calls for half.\n\n**HT** [](/NYRB) **1-0** [](/NYC)\n\n**46'** [](/whistle) Half #2 underway! No changes.\n\n**50'** RJ ALLEN ROBS SAM OFF THE LINE!!\n\n**52'** [](/NYRB) [](/goal) **GOAL** It's BWP AGAIN!! Beautiful textbook counterattack. Sam, to Kljestan, to BWP, to the back of the net!! [](/NYRB) **2-0** [](/NYC)\n\n**58'** The South Ward is pointing out that The Third Rail is not singing.\n\n**59'** [](/NYRB) [](/yellow) Lawrence booked for breaking up a NYCFC 3-on-3\n\n**62'** A shoe issue is preventing Kwadwo Poku from entering\n\n**64'** [](/NYC) [](/sub) And he's finally ready. Poku enters for Mix.\n\n**65'** Great save Robles off of Allen!\n\n**66'** EVEN BETTER STOP BY SAUNDERS TO DENY BWP'S HAT TRICK!!\n\n**68'** [](/NYC) [](/sub) Villa off for Mullins. So basically NYCFC has a USL team out there right now.\n\n**70'** [](/NYC) [](/sub) Ballouchy replaces Alvarez\n\n**72'** Mullins fires a bullet from about 20 yards out. Wide.\n\n**75'** Felipe had BWP open in the box, but instead elects to put it into Row K\n\n**76'** [](/NYC) [](/goal) **GOAL** About the only guy not named Saunders to show up for City today, Mullins gets one by Robles. This will be a fascinating last 14 minutes. [](/NYRB) **2-1** [](/NYC)\n\n**78'** [](/NYRB) [](/sub) Loud applause for BWP as he comes off. Dane Richards enters.\n\n**82'** [](/NYC) [](/yellow) RJ Allen booked for a foul on Sam\n\n**85'** Poku threatens, but Ouimette makes a great tackle. \n\n**87'** [](/NYRB) [](/sub) Last sub of the day: Roy Miller for Lloyd Sam\n\n**87'** [](/NYC) [](/yellow) to Poku for something\n\n**88'** [](/NYC) [](/yellow) Foul on the edge of the box gets Ballouchy in the book\n\n***90' Four minutes added time***\n\n**90'** [](/NYRB) [](/yellow) shown to Kljestan\n\n**90+1'** Duvall has a crack, but it's stopped rather easily by Saunders. \n\n**90+3'** Counterattack by NYRB is disrupted by a very  weak offside call\n\n**90+4'** [](/whistle) GAME.

Please tell me what, if anything i typed in the above is wrong.\nWhat is the cc of a line y=b? why would it be 1 or -1?\nHow can a cc be 0?

TL;DR at the end.\n\nA little background. 21 y/o male, been raised in the church since I was born. Fairly educated on theological concepts, at least for my age group. I really, really want to believe in God... but I feel like I can't anymore.\n\nAll my life, I've been told that Christianity is supposed to be a lifestyle. It's supposed to be a renewing of your heart and soul in Jesus. I've heard so many stories and testimonials, both from strangers and personal friends I've known, that being saved changes your whole attitude. It's supposed to be this grand thing, something that totally changes your perspective. And yet, for the 21 years I've been on this earth, I've never once felt that.\n\nI don't even think I can call myself 'saved' anymore. I want to believe in God... I truly do. I want to believe in Jesus and the redemption of my soul and the forgiveness of my sins... but I don't feel forgiveness. I don't feel love. I don't feel anything. I feel like I'm just going to church because my family expects me to, and not because I have a real, genuine desire to know God more.\n\nLike I said, I've been in the church my whole life. My parents are very studious folk when it comes to theology. I don't want to sound like I'm bragging, but for a 21 year old like myself, I consider myself more theologically educated than most people in my demographic, and even people outside of my demographic. But I feel like it's all just book smarts. I talk the talk, but I don't walk the walk, if that makes sense. I can tell you all about biblical concepts and throw all kinds of memory verses at you, but I don't feel like any of it means anything.\n\nRecently, after I started college 3 years ago, I've been slipping into depression. I dropped out of college because of it, and I've been so miserable lately that I've started going to doctors and therapy. I even specifically chose Christian-oriented therapy and doctors, as if I'm still trying to cling to what little remnants of Christianity remain in me.\n\nI won't bore you with the details of my existential misery. Lord knows I've done that enough elsewhere. So I'll just skip right to the chase and say that I'm angry at God. If He even does exist - and I really want to believe that He does - I'm angry at Him. I'm angry that He made me this way, that He seemingly ignores my condition and my past pleas for help and guidance. I used to pray every night as a child that God would change my heart and help me follow him, and I don't feel any love at all. All I feel is hate; hatred of myself for being a horrible person, and hatred of God for making me this way and putting me in this position.\n\nI don't want to hate God, but as I stated already, I just don't feel His presence. If He does exist, then He must be ignoring me, or hiding from me. I don't feel loved. I don't feel forgiven. I don't feel saved, or redeemed, or any of the feelings that are traditionally associated with Christianity. As much as I want to believe in God and know that someone loves me... I just can't do it anymore.\n\nI'm not even sure what the purpose of this post is. Advice, perhaps? Just venting? Asking for prayer? I don't know. Anything would be nice. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm depressed, nigh suicidal, and I don't feel God's love. On top of it all, my mother is here telling me that my depression is a sin and that I need to snap out of it, which doesn't help me feel better at all. I'm at the end of my rope, and I feel like I need God more than ever, but for whatever reasons, He seems content to ignore me and pretend I don't exist.\n\nTL;DR: Grew up in the church; depressed, miserable, and angry. I don't feel God's love, and I'm angry at Him, despite every rational voice in my head telling me that I shouldn't be.\n\nI'm sorry if this is not the right place... I just don't know what to do anymore.

Let's see how we can improve shall we?\n\n**Ace:**\n\nIn reality, BigBall obviously doesn't want to make him too OP, so he's probably gonna get some crappy Ace that involves giving Light players 55% pass effect boost. Oh well...\n\n**Abilities:**\n\n*Universal Oblivion*\n\nThe name itself is already amazing, dunno how I could improve it honestly. But what does it do? Well Virgil is always compared to that heretical nerd by the name of Avnore, yeah? So obviously it's better than his stupid \"Frenzy Universe*. So 70% HP heal and a 60% action bar refill!\n\n*Odin's Power*\n\nThis will become something epic like, \"Odin's Wrath\" (credit to /u/LocketPanda) which obviously gives 40% HP, Attack Power, Critical Rate, and Reflex so that Kei can join the glory of his supremacy.\n\n*Forbidden Power II*\n\nI keep suggesting \"Forbidden Power III\", other people say it should be called \"Forbidden Fruit\"; not really sure what to name it, what's important is what it does, isn't it? So this ability is the still a HP debuff to the enemies in the position. So the previous issue was that it only took a percentage off of base HP. No longer an issue! This new passive will rip off 70% of the enemy's total HP! (this includes ripping off all those HP buffs from those annoying Mikaels, Yuris, etc.)\n\n*Superiority*\n\nNew ability name? I dunno, Absolution, Supremacy, One True God... You feel me? Why don't we just combine Genius, Rush, and Collapse Camp into 1 ability! So with a penetration (must be a penetration cause come on, we don't want him to be TOO OP right? Kappa.) he gains 50% spirit for the team and recovers 50% of action and recovers 25% of his HP and then he just destroys 50% of your own spirit and action.\n\nOverall, you WILL become submissive. I've also considered creating the Book of Virgil after being called a Virgilite by /u/SoccerHeli and /u/MarisaChu from creating her own. Shall I start the reign of the Church of Virgil?!\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^99%ofthisismeanttobetakenasajoke.Ifyouseethismessage,yousawnothing.Ineversaiditwasajoke.Virgilislove,Virgilislife.", "subreddit_id": "t5_33q81"}, {"score": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/34ybly/tips_for_healing_t13/", "id": "t3_34ybly", "author": "wataru2015", "title": "Tips for Healing T13", "timecreated": 1430841550.0, "subreddit": "ffxiv", "selftext": "Hi all. \nI know there are already some threads about tips for healing T13, but I would like to pose my own questions and concerns about healing this fight. \nI am a IL 128 WHM and our static is working through T13. As a static, we have made it to divebombs. \nP1 is easy to heal and our SCH has started DPSing as I have gotten used to the fight. Our DPS still sometimes derp on the earthshakers and there has been a hiccup or two during Megaflare (mainly with people using BfB when they aren't supposed to), but other than that there are no issues. \n\nMy main problem is the phase change from P1 to P2. The add always comes for me, even if my Medica 2 goes off right during the Gigaflare explosion. I pop Shroud immediately after and USUALLY the first add doesn't end up hitting me before the OT gets it, but there have been times it does. We are having our OT move the add instead of the MT moving Bahamut (which I know is different from what most groups do), so I don't know if it is just taking him time to move and get Aggro or what, but if I die it basically causes a wipe because there's too much damage. \n\nAlso, I am standing near the NW side of the arena and the OT keeps taking the add to the SE side, so sometimes my heals on him are late and he gets down pretty low. I think we are going to switch it and have the SCH who is already over there heal him instead, and me heal the MT. Makes more sense that way. \n\nBut, my biggest problem is the 2nd add spawn. Shroud isn't up in time, and I try to get everyone topped up with Medica 1 before rage happens, but even if I do, sometimes people end up dying because they have 2 stacks. I don't have time to Stoneskin them after Megaflare and before Rage goes off because I'm focused on healing the tanks and topping everyone up. \n\nInstead of using Medica 2 before the add spawns (which is sure to take Aggro), I am going to stand in the middle and Medica 2 only after the OT takes the add (I guess I should use DS here too), but I am afraid having to pay so much attention to this timing is going to cause me to neglect healing a tank and it won't be good. \n\nMaybe our BLM can throw their virus on the add there. I could too, but I'm having to heal a lot more than I expected, and I don't know if I will have enough focus or time to do so. \n\nWhat would everyone recommend for the Gigaflare right before DBs? Should I use Cure 3 and then Medica 2? My Cure 3 does not top everyone off. It gets them to about 75% or so with DS. So, I feel I will have to Medica 2 there. \n\nAs for DBs, I know we're supposed to run to our respective sides (the same ones we used for earthshakers, but for some reason even though I am right by someone who doesn't get hit, I end up getting hit by a DB and end up in the wall). \n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me? \n\nAs for P4, I've never made it that far, but any tips on that would be appreciated too. \n\nThanks guys. <3", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7"}, {"score": 4550, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/LE01Mh7.gifv", "id": "t3_3535c9", "author": "IAmBecomeGay", "title": "The kid still finished his trick!

Gordo was found that same day roaming the neighborhood.  Mia on the other hand was nowhere to be found. His family searched for her in the neighborhood and they listed her as lost on lost dog websites. Last night my boyfriends sister saw Mia outside a neighbors yard with some kids. She called for her and once she got a good look at her realized it was Mia. She picked up Mia and the kids asked her what she was doing. When she stated she was taking her dog back they said go ahead she's annoying anyway. When she asked them about her collar they went inside and brought it out. I am a pet stylist and today they brought Mia in for a groom. It was very apparent that while this family had her they completely neglected her. She was matted, she had poop stuck completely to her rear end, and her sanitary area had tangles with blood (from heat cycle) and urine. She also seems to have gained weight and we're worried she may be pregnant. I took pictures of her coat before I shaved her just in case. Her neighbors knew she had a home and they had the contact information yet they still kept her. Isn't that considered theft? Also what about the bad condition her coat was in is that not neglect?

Its purpose is to have projectiles fling up into the air after contact, then come back down hitting the ground again after a short period.\n\nI call it *Bounce*. Picture: [http://i.imgur.com/7xZK5Ew.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7xZK5Ew.jpg)\n\n- - - \n\nSome notes about its mechanics:\n\n* Does not interact with Pierce. If a projectile would pierce, it doesn\u2019t Bounce. If a projectile bounces, it cannot Pierce afterwards. If a projectile would both Pierce and Bounce, Pierce gets priority.\n\n*Example1: Spectral throw always pierces and is not affected by Bounce.*\n\n*Example2: Ice spear Pierces through all targets in its first form, and then will Bounce off of targets in its second form (provided it does not have additional Pierce modifiers).*\n\n*Example3: Fireball explodes on a target and then Bounces, exploding again in a second nearby location.*\n\n* Fork applies before Bounce; each Forked projectile would then Bounce afterwards if it hits another target. Chain does not work with Bounce and will take priority over it.\n\n* If the projectile has AoE damage attached to it and the AoE is large enough, the AoE will hit the first target directly and after the bounce (assuming the target hasn\u2019t moved).\n\n* Projectiles supported with LMP, GMP, or the star formation will all Bounce accordingly if they hit a target.\n\n* Projectiles that miss completely or hit a wall never Bounce\n\n* Gives a damage increase to supported skills which levels up over time.\n\n* Quality gives a small AoE increase to supported skills.\n\n* Bounce \u201ctime\u201d is unaffected by projectile speed modifiers and isn\u2019t related to skill projectile speed.\n\n*Example bounce distance: half the radius of a proximity shield*\n\n* There is mechanical time between the first and second hit.\n\n*Example1: Arctic Breath supported by Bounce hits an enemy, chilling it. Its Bounce hits the same enemy again with Arctic Breath\u2019s AoE, and hits a chilled enemy for increased damage since Arctic Breath is also supported by Hypothermia.*\n\n*Example2: Fireball hits an enemy while the caster is wearing The Three Dragons helmet. Fireball explodes, shocking instead of igniting the target, then Bounces into the air. The enemy is within AoE range when Fireball comes back down, hitting a shocked target for 50% extra damage.*\n\n- - -\n\nLet me know what you think. I love being able to modify how projectiles move around the screen in PoE; putting Fork-LMP-GMP on a random projectile may not be viable but it's cool as hell! Some more projectile supports that modify how projectiles work would be fun to play around with.\n\nA prevailing theme with newer gems/updates to PoE has been \"If you aren't piercing with your projectiles, you aren't clearing things fast enough.\" - from Spectral Throw to skills like Glacial Cascade or Lightning Tendrils. Those are great skills, but we could also use support for skills that don't pierce to get them on the map.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sf6m"}, {"score": 77, "url": "http://streamable.com/mx6z", "id": "t3_354w5e", "author": "chanandlerer", "title": "DJ with the titan rejection on Dwight!", "timecreated": 1430968334.0, "subreddit": "nba", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s"}, {"score": 7, "url": "http://imgur.com/a/DKS1r", "id": "t3_3551d4", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "you can be the boss daddy", "timecreated": 1430971333.0, "subreddit": "gonewild", "selftext": "[deleted]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq5c"}, {"score": 29, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/comments/352b27/i_burned_my_lip_on_melty_cheese_and_now_it_looks/", "id": "t3_352b27", "author": "rufusadams", "title": "I burned my lip on melty cheese and now it looks like I have mouth herpes", "timecreated": 1430923595.0, "subreddit": "firstworldproblems", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sa5n"}, {"score": 533, "url": "https://open.spotify.com/user/tharamin/playlist/61tUn3swzw3aQBOxTACxFS", "id": "t3_3543mf", "author": "sheredditedit", "title": "Every song in Mad Men ever in chronological order.

UANA", "timecreated": 1430946134.0, "subreddit": "leaves", "selftext": "Dear Leavers, \n\nI write with fingers greased by the stomach linings of my vanquished foe, Marijuana. For years I lay crushed beneath her sleeping weight, a weight I did not understand, for both it and I were asleep. It was a time as confusing and mixed as my metaphors. But one day I woke up and said, \"I am tired of my lips being crumbly, my eyes being sore, and my memory being as short term as the relationships I have with cashiers.\" I think it went something like that, anyway. \n\nIt has been 14 weeks since I last smoked marijuana, and I can now say, pusillanimous, verisimilitude, transmogrify, and various other words I thought had vanished forever from my vocabulary. It is indeed a strange fixture of your brain returning to retrieve words from somewhere long lost. to of a sudden know what recalcitrant means after years of a brain so long obsessed with being so. \n\nI slew that Beast named Mary with long, terrible days of anxiety and doubt. For 12 weeks I thought nothing was possible. certainly nothing creative could be accomplished. But I knew my willpower would be needed, so I didn't really stress about that. The only reason I continued to smoke for so long (10 years chronic) was because it helped me be \"creative.\" Or, I thought I needed it to be creative. But I knew, at the same time, it was like using steroids at the gym. Somewhere my balls were shrinking. What seemed beneficial short term was really creating long term. The theory went, Eventually, with abstinence, the long term benefits of not smoking weed would outweight the short term pleasure of being high. Around week 13 I had enough willpower to just start doing things without worrying. \"It doesn't have to be good, it just has to be something\" is the motto. I am starting to make things again, albeit perhaps with less enthusiasm and in a slower way. However, that's the legacy of weed, and it's not because I don't \"enjoy\" being creative. It's because I've trained my brain to think it needs weed. The first sign of progress is proof greater progress can be made and so I buy in more and more to myself when I do something small. I am building bigger and bigger things. For me, this has so much to do with becoming more intelligent in your psychology. It has been very beneficial, but also very trying, and very depressing at times. However, those low points are proof that your brain is healing, going through necessary things, and letting you get to that next place. You want to give in at the more stressful times, but they're the times that prove more than any to yourself that what you're doing is actually getting you somewhere. That's the paradox. You must interpret the stress as positive evidence, and not something to escape. Once you have that perspective, it's much easier to avoid getting high to escape the pain. You just say, Ah, the pain is proof. And something about proof being pudding and pudding is nice, so no weed for me thank you. \n\nI have found this place to be very helpful. Just knowing there's other creatives and weirdos or just people not wanting to get high anymore helps me not get high. I feel now like I am not \"a stoner\" anymore, and I much more identify with the benefits of sobriety. It is very nice. \n\nHere is something I made about addiction. An analogy about abusing any substance. Because if we did anything with as much intensity and consistency as we smoked weed, people would be concerned...\n\n[Oatmeal Dave](https://soundcloud.com/fartsmellrr86/oatmeal-dave)\n\nMaybe that will help. It has helped me. So, for anyone struggling with being creative without weed, just know, it does get better, but you have to work for it to get there. I spend so much time now just forcing myself to write, or get into characters, or do stand up, or record. I just say, Give it 25minutes. Find some Positive Addictions. Become addicted to your processes, and not your outcomes. Because eventually you will produce something. But it's a matter of letting your filter down, and acknowledging, yeah, you probably kinda do suck right now.

It's now a year and a few months of paying (still owing 7100 despite regular $200 monthly payments) later and we are constantly harassed with upsell calls and have no interest in ever using the timeshare due to the frustration and terrible experiences with the company. We want to cut all ties with the company and are considering foreclosure because we're at a loss after doing a lot of online research. Obviously we don't want to foreclose due to all the negative consequences but we don't know what else to do. Continuing to pay them forever or pay it off and give it back to them don't seem much better than foreclosure at this point, though that seems to be the other common options. I have no idea where to start as far as considering selling it, and doubt it would sell due to being very undesirable and a notorious company. Everywhere that mentions selling timeshares feels like a scam. I've been considering going to a realty lawyer but then I'm just spending more money, despite probably knowing the options they'll go over. Has anyone been through this, have advice, or anything that might be useful in my scenario? We and the timeshare are in Texas.

However, how would various factions be depicted in a way that is very different morally from how they are typically perceived?\n\nFor example, people would generally assume that UBG(Sultai) would be evil. But perhaps it could be depicted as a good group of rebels. The logical and selfish(UB) aspects of it fuel rebellion, and the logical and community-oriented(UG) aspects of it push it towards being a force of good, although its methods may still be extreme(B).\n\nOr WBR(Mardu) could be the primary good faction if it was a faction with a strong moral compass(W) and respect and empathy for individuals(R), but filled with a pervasive sense of hatred and resentment(B) and an intense desire to seize power(B). \n\nI'm not sure how some factions would be the \"opposite\" of what they normally are, though. How would URB(grixis) be depicted as good? How would WUR(jeskai) be depicted as evil? How would URG(temur) be depicted as a moral extreme(very good or very evil)? I also have a hard time imagining UWG(Bant) as evil, but one idea is like one of those sci-fi dystopias where everyone is locked into a society and there is no growth and no freedom. The strictness of azorius, but with green's sense of community heightening groupthink and green's sense of \"do not question or go against the order of things\" applied to the society's situation instead of green pursuing growth and \"actual\" nature. UG would also be expressed in that in terms of trying to create the \"perfect\" stable society. It would also be green in the sense that the society rejections confrontation, and thus rejects change and stays stagnant.

Android tablets do not get enough love as they should due to tablets usually being second thought for most OEMs.\n\n&nbsp; \n\nI wanted WLauncher's main focus to be bring the Windows 8 start grid to Android. The reason for this is, it's currently the best implementation of a scaling UI on any device. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOver the last few months, this transformed into Windows 8 layout for tablet and Windows Phone layout for phones. This became extremely annoying to code as there were different algorithms to sort the grid from tablet to phone, different code to build the apps drawer and so on.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter getting really annoyed at essentially managing duplicate but slightly different code, I scrapped the phone UI and optimized the tablet UI for smaller screens.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow on every device, you have a single layout that is based on the Windows 8 start screen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis allowed me to keep the code cleaner, optimize only one set of code, and implement new tile types and features a lot quicker.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere is a gallery of the latest version of WLauncher running on a Galaxy S6: [WLauncher on the Galaxy S6](http://imgur.com/a/QuZTN)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere is a short narrated demo by me guiding you through the current feature set of WLauncher on a Galaxy S6 in 2K 60FPS: [WLauncher Narrated Demo on the Galaxy S6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH34bmXHrvI)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo other than the interface change and unification across devices, the most apparent new feature is the contextual menu on the left of the start grid.\n\nThis is pretty much the same as the new start menu on Windows 10. It provides quick links to all apps, settings, and store the five most used apps on your device. For phones it works as a navigation drawer and on tablets its part of the start grid and always there.\n\n[Contextual Menu for Phones](http://i.imgur.com/pbNyFjt.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCurrent WLauncher Features:\n\n* Unified Scaling UI - The user interface is 99% similar across tablets and phones and will scale to any screen size without cramping of widgets and apps or any input from the user.\n* Start Grid - The ability to resize, drag-and-drop, remove applications and widgets from the start grid with ease.\n* Widget Support - Support for all widgets with multiple tile sizes and the ability to remove the tile backgrounds.\n* Application Drawer - A listing of all installed apps on a horizontal scrolling grid with the ability to quick navigate through the user of headers.\n* Contextual Menu - Provides quick access to the addition of custom tiles, personalization, settings, and 5 of your most used apps.\n* Personalization - The ability to change the launchers colour theme with a real time preview. \n* Icon Pack Support - WLauncher supports all icon packs with the ability to make the icons take up the entire space of the tile.\n* Folder Tile - Folders are implemented in a unique way with WLauncher. They can hold up to 16 apps and when pressed, they push the tiles of the grid out of the way to make room for the contents of the folder.\n* Contact Tile - The ability to pin contacts to the start grid. When a contact is tapped, it make room in the grid for four tiles. The four tiles being call, message, view, and share.\n* Animations - Nearly everything in WLauncher is nicely animate. From drag and drop to resizing of tiles, everything has an animation added to it. Take a look at the YouTube video above to see.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlanned Features of WLauncher:\n\n* Website Tiles - Provide the ability to pin websites to the start screen. This is 50% implemented, there are just some issues grabbing the website icon for the tile.\n* Large Website Tiles - Provides RSS feed support for tiles the same way as Windows 8. Essentially allows websites on large 4x4 tiles with an RSS feed if implemented by a website.\n* Custom Widgets - A custom widget tile which allows for me to easily implement widgets that can animate and provide extra functionality over standard Android widgets. This will include things like a dynamic phone and messaging tile, weather etc.\n* Individual Tile Customization - The ability for a user to customize tiles independently of the main theme. This could be either using a different icon pack, hiding the title, maximizing the icon.\n* Cross Device Sync - The ability to sync your start grid across devices. If an app isn't installed on one, it is simply greyed out and when tapped will take you to the store listing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo that's pretty much it with WLauncher for today. Incase you missed it in the post above, take a look at the following links.\n\n[Gallery of WLauncher on the GS6](http://imgur.com/a/QuZTN)\n\n[WLauncher Narrated Demo on the Galaxy S6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH34bmXHrvI)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for stopping by and sharing your interested in WLauncher.

This post will be revised to remove all RedBird references in the near future.  A Moment of Silence Please.**\n\nIf you had access to Walmart and VGCs, loading Bluebird and Serve using VGCs . Plenty of folks bypassed Redbird, and stayed with the tried and true.  The field really has been equalized at this point.\n\nThe one thing folks haven't been broadcasting, is the cost of VGC loading.  I wanted to put something together to highlight how the value proposition of VGC loading is now very different than CC loading.\n\n##The Basics of VGC loading to Bluebird/Serve/Redbird\n\nFirst of all, why does VGC loading work?  VGCs are really Prepaid Debit cards that can be processed on the Visa network.  They can be used where Visa are accepted, and many have PIN to allow them to be processed as debit cards.  Unlike True debit cards, you cannot withdraw cash from an ATM using a VGC, even though they are labeled as debit cards.  So think of them as Prepaid Debit Cards that can only be used to spend, not cash out.  Note that the American Express Gift Cards, or AGCs, do not offer a PIN feature, and cannot be used to load at Walmart or Target.\n\nWalmart have always accepted loading to Bluebird/Serve using Debit and Cash.  So for years, churners have taken advantage of VGC's PIN feature to masquerade true debit cards, and used them to load.  Over time, this has been also used by fraudsters to liquidate illegitimate VGCs, and this has led Walmart to crack down in 2014.  Some Walmarts refuse debit card loads unless the debit card has your name embossed.  Walmart POS has been hard coded to refuse VGCs from InComm from performing transactions $50 or higher.  InComm VGCs are commonly sold under the \"Vanilla\" brand, and this encompass Vanilla gift cards, OneVanilla cards, and their other products.  It is unclear whether Walmart has placed restrictions on InComm cards for other reasons, such as cost or contract issues.  Note that the restriction on InComm cards applies to Walmart registers, and the automated kiosk known as KATE.\n\nWhen Target blocked CC load to Redbird, they followed Walmart's path, and only allow Cash and Debit load.  The same loophole for VGCs remain, except Target has not YET systematically blocked any VGCs.  So if you have a PIN enabled VGC, you can go to Target, ask to load your Prepaid Redcard for x dollars, CSR punches some keys, you swipe your Redcard, CSR punch in the dollar figure, you swipe your VGC, press Debit, and then punch in the PIN.  If everything happens as it should, then you now loaded your Redbird.  Note that there are reports some Targets now check for name on your debit card, which in effect blocks most VGC loading.\n\nWhere the manufactured spend happens, is when you acquire the VGC.  There are many retailers that sells VGCs including supermarkets, office supply stores, online retailers.  Many of them accepts a CC as a valid payment method.  So unlike the previous CC load at Target, you now earn points when you swipe your CC to buy the VGC.  The swiping of the VGC at Target to load Redbird is now just a way to get your money back.\n\n## Pros of using VGCs\n\nThe ability to buy VGCs at different retailers open up things like category bonus at office supply store and grocery store, and also cash back portals.  So instead of earning 1-2 points by swiping at Target, you can earn 5x by using Chase Ink Plus to buy VGCs at OfficeMax.  So the $5k a month on Redbird can now potentially earn you 25,000 UR points a month.  5% back at grocery stores can be a good money maker.\n\nVGCs help you meet minimum spend easily by shifting spend if you can afford to float the funds.  You can buy many VGCs in a day by visiting multiple retailers and clearing Fraud alerts, and meet a $5000 minimum spend without breaking a sweat.  You have plenty of time to liquidate the VGCs over the coming weeks/months.\n\nThrough the use of online portals and potentially adding a step with AGC, you can offset most if not all costs associated with VGCs.  You do incur additional risk with money tied up without a clear liquidation path.\n\n## The Cons of VGCs\n\nFirst of all, VGCs are not free.  When you purchase a VGC, you usually have to pay an activation fee, ranging from $3.95 to $6.95.  VGCs comes in certain denominations, ranging anywhere from $25 to $500.  There are also variable VGCs that you can load from $1-$500 based on your needs. OfficeMax Staples sell $200 VGCs for $6.95 activation fee.  This means even if you are getting 5x points, you are now paying $0.007 per point, vs the free points you enjoyed with Redbird.  So the cost of a point you earn from VGC includes:\n\n- acquisition cost such as shipping\n- activation fee\n- cost to goto Walmart or Target\n- More swipes and time to load because of the smaller face value\n\nVGCs are redeemable by anyone holding them.  So if you lose a VGC, someone who finds it can spend it with no concern, and you will have to go through a painful process to hope to reclaim the money.\n\nVGCs have activation issues.  Many people have walked out of the store with their new VGCs, and then find out later they were never activated.  You would then have to work with the store, using the receipts you kept, and hopefully get your money back.\n\nVGCs have fraud issues.  Folks have purchase VGCs, and found that fraudsters have previously tampered with the package, and now their money is gone.  You would then have to work with the store and potentially file a police report to try to get your money back.\n\nThe acceptance of VGCs by Walmart and Target should be treated as YMMV.  As Both retailers have demonstrated, they have the ability to update their POS systems to block VGC loading at anytime.  You don't want to be the person that bought thousands of dollars in VGC, and then find out your liquidation path is gone.\n\n## Where can I buy VGC, and which ones do I buy?\n\nThe answer here, and the one that people don't like, is \"It Depends.\"  But the reality is, store policy changes quickly, the products they carry changes quickly.\n\nStaples, Office Max, Walmart, Target, Krogers, gas station, and many other stores sell VGCs.  However, not all of them accepts CC for payment, and it even differs from store to store in the same neighborhood.\n\nSo your best bet is trial and error.  Find a store that sells them, and buy a small face value one, say $50 with a CC.  Take it to your store to liquidate.  If you succeed, then ramp it up slowly based on your needs.  If not, spend the $50 in some other way, and then try it again with a different card.\n\n**Remember: Always Keep All Receipts!**\n## Conclusion\n\nVGCs in conjunction with Redbird, Bluebird, and Serve is very valuable to churners.  They can help meet minimum spend with low cost, but the cost and the risk involved make them less desirable for generating rewards.  You have to do the math, and decide  whether the cost and the effort is worth it for the amount of points you generate.  The days of easy points for free at Target are over.\n\n\n\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vrf0"}, {"score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/35ffs8/do_you_think_joseph_campbell_will_have_as_much_of/", "id": "t3_35ffs8", "author": "SanthidTatt", "title": "Do you think Joseph Campbell will have as much of an impact on the ST as he did on the OT?

I played FFXI for 10+ years and always loved being able to summon fairly large and awesome looking summons. The egi's just don't cut it for me. Today I was thinking about something that i think would really pull summoner together for me.\n\nIn the story we learn about Lady Iceheart and how she is able to essentially become a summon (Shiva). What I was thinking; is that in the xpack summoners could get an ability that allows them to merge with their egi's to become a larger version of the primal. This would essentially transform their character into a smaller version of the primal and allow them the ability to control it for, i dunno, say 60 seconds. It would be on a 5 minute cooldown or so. They would also have a Revert ability like Terra in FF6 that would allow them to leash incase they were needed for some other reason. This would satisfy my need for larger cooler looking summons personally.\n\nAs far as story goes the summoner quest could be about three trials to earn the respect of the primals to allow this to happen or something along those lines. It could also talk about how the summoners trainer got the idea from lady iceheart, but only the strongest adventurers could achieve it. Perhaps the trials could be defeating lesser versions of the primals alone ah la FFXI.\n\nAnyways let me know what you think about my thinking.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7"}, {"score": 43, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/35f1l9/what_will_be_the_best_and_worst_divisions_in_the/", "id": "t3_35f1l9", "author": "FlannelBeard", "title": "What Will be the Best and Worst Divisions in the NFL this season and Why?", "timecreated": 1431197248.0, "subreddit": "nfl", "selftext": "Provide some reasoning on why you think a division will be good or bad.

I've had Demon's Souls for a while now. Ever since I bought my first PS3 almost four years ago, but I never got deep into it (just making it past Tower Knight, and a little into StoneFang). But, a few guys at work were talking about the Souls Games, and got my to try it again... AND I FUCKING LOVED IT. I regret not playing it sooner. I played it a lot and made a few characters. I even am pretty deep into NewGame+. But, one thing I wanted to get into was the community, and even though /r/demonssouls is full of great people, the community is thinning. It's hard to find a coop partner/invade in most places.\n\nSo, I did the logical thing, and get one of the newer games. Well, awhile ago I bought Dark Souls 1 because I though that I was going to get into it, but my PS3 broke, and couldn't get back to it until just recently. Well, when I decided it was time to try Dark Souls 1... well, turns out the guy accidentally gave me Dark Souls 2 instead. Not complaining, even though I wanted to try Dark Souls 1 first. \n\nBut anyways, what I'm really asking, is if there is someone that has come from Demon's Souls, what can I expect to be different, and what can I look for? I want to use a DEX build, so something similar to the Uchiganata/StickyCompoundLongBow build. I don't want to look up too many guides, but honestly when I was in the Forest of Giants, I got pretty far and died without realizing that there were bonefires along the way to save my progress. Pretty stupid of me huh. xD So, I'm just looking for some hints and maybe some good weapons that I can look out for.

Should I try my luck and write an email to them?\n\nHere is the order confirmation they sent with the packages: http://i.imgur.com/oj64H2u.jpg\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to say I live in Denmark and it got taken in customs. My order from Snusline was about 35 euro and tax was 34, so about 100% the original price... I can also see now that they removed the \"Buy 10 get 12...\" on the product description on their site: http://www.snusline.com/index.php/white-portion/odens-69-extreme-white-dry-portion-snus.html\n\nIt also only says \"Extreme dry portion 10gr\" even though the product description says it's 22mg/g.... Im really not digging Snusline right now. \n\nIm really confused. Should I write to them or?we", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rn86"}, {"score": 28, "url": "http://www.sub-cultured.com/steven-universe-helped-me-like-things-again/", "id": "t3_35fgy1", "author": "comicgirl9", "title": "it's rad to see that such a fantastic cartoon is impacting lives, of all ages.", "timecreated": 1431205614.0, "subreddit": "stevenuniverse", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2viyl"}, {"score": 589, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/35f7g5/in_the_xmen_universe_would_you_be_pro_mutant_or/", "id": "t3_35f7g5", "author": "kiblick", "title": "In the X-Men universe, would you be pro mutant or anti mutant, and why?", "timecreated": 1431200426.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "You are a human.

Need motivation ASAP!!", "timecreated": 1431195125.0, "subreddit": "GetMotivated", "selftext": "Friends, this post is not for upvotes but it is for sheer motivation. \n\nLet me give my background, I'm 27 years old. I am still studying and doing part time job. All my friends are well settled. But I had meet a tragic event. I had drowned in lake at age of 15. Since then my brain was damaged. Doctors said don't have alcohol or any hard drinks and don't study much as your brain is not capable of taking it. I dint gave up. I gradually passed my exams but at a very low pace. Today, all my friends of my age have got into good jobs. But I am still studying and doing part time job for survival. My only friends are guys which are around my vicinity. So this is my quick background. \n\nToday (May 9, 2015), it was my friend's wedding. At times, he was one of my best friend, he invited me. I went there. I meet all friends, gradually one after the other spoke about their job and success they have reached. It said \"I'm studying and part time job\" Few of my friends giggled. I asked \"what's joke?\" None of them replied. Then after  sometime one friend pointed me and said \"thank god, I became doctor or else I would have been loser like him\". I joked and replied \"not my fault, I'm doing my best\".  My friends whose wedding was today he said \"successful people don't be friend with unsuccessful people still I invited you to my marriage\" I got hurt and I asked him \"why you all targeting me today\" one friend who was girl said we don't like losers in our group\" i asked my friend \"why you invited me at first place?\" He said \"it was a mistake.\" I got tears in my eyes. And place gift on the desk which I had brought for my friend and left the ceremony...\n\nIs it necessary to have success faster to be in society?\nI never did bad for anyone nor I thought bad for anyone. It was a worst day of my life. I am highly demotivated just cause I dint succeed faster in my life. I feel like ending my life, but while typing this, I felt good that I have some community to share but I am from inside I'm broken and don't know how to face such in life. \n\nPlease help! :'(\n\nEdit:\nThank you from the bottom of my heart!! I cried so much that I'm getting severe headaches.  \nI'm under  urgent medication treatment. Wasted my tears. \nI really can't believe my eyes, such humanity does exist, few hours back I had almost lost faith in humanity. Thanks a lot. I wont ever forget such great souls whom i virtually met! I pray to god that your all good karma payback you in sweetest fruit. \nSorry, I currently can't reply. But I'll make sure, I'll reply as soon as I can.\n\nEdit: Post 19 hours \nOnce again, I'm sorry would love to reply individually. But for now, I am making a general reply, I hope you guys don\u2019t mind if words made you feel left out. I will keep coming back to read and motivate myself. \n\nThe support and love which I have got here is truly like heaven. I could see the lights in darkness. All the advices having deep understanding, kindness, inspiration, friendly advices, motivation, quotes, videos, stories, caring words, those hands for friendship, those appreciation, the tears you guys felt\u2026 it touched my heart and this thread has became a landmark place on the internet for proving that humanity will never die. No matter how far \"the bad\" grow, \"the good\" will always mark it's presences with beautiful souls like you. You guys have not only supported me but also have supported millions of good people out there who face such painful incidents in this cruel world. Words/upvotes are not enough to say thank you. \n\nFake and post history\nSome users claimed it to be untrue. You are perfectly correct as just words can\u2019t prove it.  May be I failed to convey it or something that I couldn't make it believable. Situation was such, I found it difficult to believe about what happened to me. About post history, reason to join reddit was to give my brain an extra boost that I succeed as fast as I can. /r/NoFap was the community which inspired me to join reddit with the hope that I will reboot or rewire my brain. And I feel that it helped me a lot and as it helped me I try to help people out there and get helped too. /r/TheXeffect gave me willpower. And that's all what my post history says.\n\nGlided by gold!!\nI really don\u2019t deserve it. It is you all guys and reddit which deserve it. Which is partly achieved. I'll make sure that I return back the love with best possible means.\n\n\nRIP English!\nSorry, some users felt my English improper. I had typed so haphazardly but in that situation it was hard for me to even think. But I tried to fix grammar as much I could. Thanks for making me aware. I respect all those comments too. Also one kind hearted person came forward to help me.\nI was very emotional while I was typing the post. And as I said, I felt like ending my life but while typing I got relaxed as I have someone to read or someone to share my pain. \nI believe biggest room in the world is room for improvement. \nI will make sure that I will learn and please don't hesitate to teach me or point it out. \n\nAbout my health, \nI am better now. Mentally stronger and how can I stay ill when I got such positive energy reading all your comments. Stay happy and I wish that best things happen in your life.\n\nAbout my friends,\nGuys said \"F### those friends\" that shows how much pain you felt for me. Thank you for your support. \nNow those \"friends\" makes me feel that I'm better then them. \nI couldn't forget those words, it kept echoing in my head.  But as a user said forgive and forget don\u2019t keep negativity. I have forgiven them and it won't  keep any hard feelings. Even if anyone ask for help I will help. I won't spoil my heart filling negativity. But I learnt how people can be. Those words are not breaking me anymore. I'm taking it as motivation and I would never depart from my goals!\nThank you, you all are amazing. \n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rmfx"}, {"score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/35e0e9/base_what_th9_base_is_this/", "id": "t3_35e0e9", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "[BASE] What TH9 base is this?", "timecreated": 1431174544.0, "subreddit": "ClashOfClans", "selftext": "[deleted]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2usfk"}, {"score": 3620, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/hGFB2LQ.jpg", "id": "t3_35e887", "author": "proindifference", "title": "After hitting the game winning shot...", "timecreated": 1431180449.0, "subreddit": "funny", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh33"}, {"score": 14, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV_PC/comments/35ewl8/how_do_i_get_rid_of_stuttering_and_pop_ins/", "id": "t3_35ewl8", "author": "nickjakubiak", "title": "How do i get rid of stuttering and pop ins", "timecreated": 1431194536.0, "subreddit": "GrandTheftAutoV_PC", "selftext": " Specs- GTX 970 (4 GB VRAM)\nI5 4690k\n8 GB Ram\nIm getting constant stuttering at any settings but the game is still playing at 60 fps.

The scale and variety of the visuals, the heart wrenching score, Ewan McGregor, etc...\n\nBut what strikes me most about ROTS is how strong the general narrative flow is. It's probably the most artfully and effectively constructed movie in the series since Empire Strikes Back, just in terms of editing and pacing. Almost every moment in the first half of the movie feels like it's  leading to the point where Anakin makes his choice and the Emperor springs his trap, and it's like watching a the moment before a train wreck. There's a really effective sense of dread in this movie, especially with that incredible scene of Anakin and Padme sensing each other across the city. And then, literally halfway through (I checked when I watched it last night, it's almost exactly at the midpoint of the movie) the train goes off the rails, Anakin kills Mace, and everything just gets progressively more tragic and crazy. Its such an odd pace for a movie, to have the major climactic turning point in the middle and have the rest of the movie deal with the fallout, but it totally works. \n\nI was in middle school when this movie came out. My mom picked me and my friend up out of PE on Friday morning so we could go see it (best mom ever) and I remember just being blown away. That movie was a serious crowd pleaser when it came out. I still remember people cheering at key moments (Yoda with the guards). I still remember crying watching Anakin burn for the first time.

More open: I accidentally killed a guy on a bike because everyone started shooting at him... We also wouldn't let several people into the safe zone. \n4. Perimeter guards: if it hadn't been for a civilian outside the wall, we might have had a breach in the safe zone. We were also constantly under enemy watch.\n5. Command: we need to have at least one officer at base at all times. We had to call a red alert several times due to ghosters and no command leading to panic.\n\nI had a lot of fun.

Every time we'd resolve something and be looking forward to moving passed it, something else would happen. As a result, I'm leaving my partner. He no longer respects me, lies to me about multiple things to get his way, and is (not sure if consciously) incredibly manipulative.\n\nDon't get me wrong, he's not a bad person. He's just got the maturity of a 15 year old, which I didn't quite realize until we were living together and sharing finances. It was one of those \"when things were good\" relationships, where everything was incredible when it was good and things were heartbreaking when it was bad.\n\nFor the past four months, I've been waiting to talk to him. We had a huge blow out over him lying to me about stuff, and I moved back into my mum's because he wouldn't listen to me; was convinced the argument was about a friend of his, not our relationship. Long story short on that, months of him criticizing me over everything (from how I cooked rice to how I fucking breathed; literally) combined with him being constantly going on about how amazing another woman was and how I'd never understand him like her. Oh and he said if they were single they'd have sex, that she had a thing for him, and lied to me about going to see her multiple times. I don't think he cheated on me, I wouldn't have questioned it before, but now...? Yes. I question it.\n\nIt doesn't matter really, because that wasn't what the fight was about. I was trying to explain how awful he'd been treating me, and how hurtful he was being about all this, and how I needed that feeling of insecurity revolving his relationship with her out of our lives for awhile for us to move passed it all. If I'd felt like my partner respected and cared for me, I wouldn't have had to ask that of him at all. I didn't even demand it. I just said I needed that, and he then went off on a 50 minute rant trying to twist things around on me. At one point he literally said \"YOU DIDN'T CARE I WAS SPEAKING TO HER WHEN YOU DIDN'T KNOW!\"\n\nThe apparent reason for his sudden change in his treatment of me is a severe depression. He's never been depressed before, and it's like it's brought all his worst traits out with a vengeance. He said he couldn't deal with having a conversation about our relationship until he'd left the apartment. So I spent about 3 months trying to help him in every way I could, still staying there quite a lot because his cat needed minding while he was in work and he refused to have it brought down with my cat. Depression is a horrible things guys, I know it well, I've suffered it for years and I know how debilitating it can be. I cooked, I cleaned, I cuddled, I supported. I did everything I could, and even agreed not to pressure him about talking even though he was taking forever. Of course, I've been really, really hurt by it all. I really needed to talk and had my own feelings over all of it that I never got to sort out. About a month ago I called him up and asked if I could stay at the apartment that night. I met him in work, and was so unwell and tired that I fell asleep at his workplace until we went home. We get back and he asks what's up. I tell him that the last few months have been really difficult for me,that I'm essentially miserable and lonely and incredibly stressed on all fronts, and that while I know it's not okay to talk about the shite, can I just have some support? And proceed to break down in very bottled up tears and be folded in his arms for a few seconds.\n\nNow I've spent the last 3 months literally being there for him in every way he could ask; and did ask for. He literally didn't last 5 minutes, with me still there absolutely crying my heart out in his arms, before starting on another monologue about his problems. That he's told me about for hundreds of hours at this point. I ended up leaving in tears and going home. He couldn't even give me one evening, hell 10 minutes, of cuddling and support without it being about how he felt.\n\nNow four months since the fight, nearly 5 and he's finally moved back with his mum. We were meant to speak three weeks ago, but he forgot it was his mum's birthday and essentially spent all his days off with his dad and then was like \"whoops\", so we postponed it to last Sunday. He said he still needed to clean shit out of the apartment (I'm not even going to get into how incompetent he's been about all this. To the point where it's unacceptable.) He asked if we could talk Monday so he wouldn't be so wrecked. Sure, I said. So Monday rolled around and I didn't hear anything from him until 4, when he said he'd just woken up and had to do a bunch of stuff. He got one of those things done before he went for a bus at nearly 8pm; and had forgotten his bank card so he couldn't pay for it. The next bus wasn't for another hour, and by the time he got down to my mum's he'd have only been able to stay for 30 minutes including walking time before getting the last bus home. Did I mention he was the one that insisted we do it here? I offered to go up.\n\nAnyway, as you can imagine. I'm frustrated and hurt and just want to get this over with. I love that man, even after all this. I can't not, he was my partner for years and years but I can't stay in this relationship with someone who literally says things like \"I have no respect for you anymore\", then when I bring them saying that up they say \"Oh well I said it in the heat of the moment I didn't really mean it\" or blaming their depression on mine. Or telling me I don't understand how the world works, when I *clearly* understand how to get shit done more than him. \n\nMy problem is he's delusional. Actually delusional I think. He's smoked weed for years and has an incredibly sketchy memory as a result, but I didn't realize how bad it was until the last while. I mean it was always annoying as shite and caused many problems, but now I'm not so sure he was telling the truth.   \n\nHe's after telling me he's been waiting for me to talk to him these last four months. He's essentially trying to play all of it off as a misunderstanding, and I *know* he was *fully aware* of our stipulations and deal. He can say he forgot all he wants, but the last month I've been pretty blatant in my \"I'm tired of waiting. We talking or what?\". Everyone who I've spoken to about this is just like \"...what?\". I smoke weed for medicinal purposed. I have a chronic illness with severe nerve inflammation, and honestly it's the only way I can get shit done physically. It's wonderful! I understand it's effects and I divvy it out each week. It improves my life more than words can say, even if I'd rather not be a little doped up all the time. \n\nHe's now essentially telling me I don't remember anything, I don't know how I feel, I don't know what I want, that I have a severe drug problem, that it was him waiting for me to talk to him these past few months, that while I was staying there to help out he thought everything was fine between us, *I'm* the one with the drug problem (which I suppose I do a bit with my usage), and I'm suddenly twisting everything around on him. WHAT?! I'm so upset. I had a letter I'd written to him, explaining how I felt about his behavior and how it had effected me and just saying he needed to grow up a bit and open his eyes to how he was treating the people around him he cared about. It's not just me he's treating like this. But now I know he's just going to refute it all, because according to him *none of that is what happened*. \n\nI don't know what to do Reddit. He's coming over tomorrow to meet me, and I think the only thing I can say is \"I'm leaving you.\" and don't even think I can tell him why. I feel like he's not the person I fell in love with. Or that that person never really existed. My heart is broken reddit, and my partner is apparently so out of touch with reality that they can twist it in their own head to make themselves seem like a victim when he was literally emotionally abusing me. No wonder he always had such confidence.\n\nHow do I deal with this reddit?\n\n**tl;dr**: My partner has such a bad memory from drug use that he's been able to completely rearrange the events from the last year to make himself seem like an amazing person in his head, and me to be the cause of all of our problems. I know this isn't true, but now I have no idea how to explain why I'm leaving him tomorrow. He's essentially delusional, but I don't want to just say \"It's over\" and leave it. I wanted to discuss things like adults, not nitpick over who did what. How do I deal with this, reddit?\n\nPS:) Also I'm completely heartbroken and on my last emotional and mental reserves from dealing with both my problems AND his for the last four and a half months all alone. I know he's not good for me, I know I have to leave him because this relationship isn't bringing out the best in either of us. But I love him so much and I feel like this is killing me. It was going to be hard enough when it was just supposed to be us discussing things. Now I'm going to have to defend our fucking history. Wtf guys? Like seriously.

Let's call the girl Alice and the guy Bob for the sake of discussion.\n\nIn late December 2013, I discovered that I was transgender (MtF). I was terrified of someone finding out, though, so I told no one, until my dysphoria got worse and I came out to Alice in November 20, 2014 (Transgender Day of Remembrance). She's at a different high school, though, so we couldn't talk face to face.\n\nMore recently my dysphoria got worse still, and I learned Bob is moving away and might never see me again (along with another of my friends whom we will call Carl.)\n\nI came out to him last Thursday so I could have some relief and so Bob would move away knowing who I truly was. \n\nHere's where it gets troubling. Bob contacted Alice via text and confessed that he didn't believe me. Here is the transcript of their conversation:\n\nBob: Did [boyname] tell you his \"secret\"?\n\nAlice: I've known since like September. I was the first he told... BTW, it's [girlname] not [boyname], but I can call her [girlnickname] cause I'm special like that.\n\nBob: 1. I think he could have chosen a better name. **2. Just between you and me, I think this could be a phase. I've never seen him exhibit any feminine attributes. Also, remember that time when he became [REDACTED]* last summer? Yeah. It could be like that.**\n\nI'm not anti-transgender, but I doubt his credibility.\n\nAlice: The name did take some getting used to, and I know about the [REDACTED]* thing, but if this were a phase, would it really be this hard to come out? She's really paranoid and the least we can do is support her.\n\nSo, if this was a private conversation, how did I get the transcript? Simple: Alice screenshotted it and emailed it to me, saying \"I strongly advise against telling Bob you know about this.\"\n\nHere's the dilemma. I have two options here:\n\n1. Explain to Bob why he is wrong, and that I really am trans. However, this would also result in Bob no longer trusting Alice, and Alice no longer trusting me.\n\n2. Don't tell Bob anything, just let him think I'm confused and keep on using his flawed logic. This completely defeats the purpose of coming out to him; so he could know who I really was, and so I could have someone to talk to face to face about my problems, albeit for a few weeks.\n\nIs this truly a no-win scenario? Or is there a way out?\n\n*I redacted this because it would likely start a flame war and distract the commenters from the actual problem.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjdm"}, {"score": 361, "url": "http://tidal.com/us/jay-z-0516-live", "id": "t3_367xlo", "author": "Iotatl", "title": "Jay Z B Sides Concert - Live Stream NO ACCOUNT NEEDED", "timecreated": 1431824694.0, "subreddit": "hiphopheads", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rh4c"}, {"score": 2546, "url": "http://imgur.com/8EQR6NW", "id": "t3_365v4k", "author": "FreeEdgar2014", "title": "For our second anniversary, my girlfriend bought me a Charmander Shepard t-shirt!", "timecreated": 1431781580.0, "subreddit": "pokemon", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb"}, {"score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/3683yp/offically_quitting_h1z1/", "id": "t3_3683yp", "author": "Layzin", "title": "Offically quitting h1z1", "timecreated": 1431828800.0, "subreddit": "h1z1", "selftext": "[removed]", "subreddit_id": "t5_31a08"}, {"score": 1835, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/vsj9THS.gifv", "id": "t3_366rlh", "author": "AShellfishLover", "title": "You'll never leave again, right?", "timecreated": 1431800932.0, "subreddit": "aww", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o"}, {"score": 4869, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/3668cs/i_wonder_if_spiders_get_as_pissed_off_as_i_do/", "id": "t3_3668cs", "author": "elonc", "title": "I wonder if spiders get as pissed off as I do when I walk through their webs...", "timecreated": 1431790290.0, "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo"}, {"score": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShonenIdle/comments/367cgi/new_version/", "id": "t3_367cgi", "author": "Kawloran", "title": "New version", "timecreated": 1431812334.0, "subreddit": "ShonenIdle", "selftext": "Hey guys, we have patched with a new version.\nThe changes are:\n\n- New mini-game.

He threatened immediate action if I didnt acknowledge my debt over the phone -- such as garnishing my wages, and something about a 1099.  He demanded to know \"Do you agree to pay or refuse to pay the $1700\"? \n\nNot knowing my options, I said it was a bad time to speak I'd have to call him back.

so i found this subreddit! :)\n\nI had my very first threesome on thursday night and it actually came about because of a pretty poor joke aha basically i was out with my boyfriend (student nights here are on wednesday and thursday) and he told me that he wanted to fuck me when we got in, then cum in my mouth. I responded with the amazing line \"the only way youre gonna put it in my mouth after sex tonight is if it's because someone else is still fucking me\" now believe me, this was not meant as an invitation but he just looked at me and said completely straight-faced, \"okay, lets get someone.\"\n\nit was actually pretty hot in a weird way, dancing with my boyfriend but being actively encouraged to look at other guys and find one for us to talk to aha\n\nin the end it was a lot simpler than that, my boyfriend's in the basketball team for our university (no hes not black before anyone asks, hes also not very good haha) and we bumped into some of the second team about an hour later and one of them was a whole other level of hot. dont get me wrong, i love my boyfriend and i think hes gorgeous but this guy was too hot aha.\n\nSo i told him id made my choice and he said that seeing as i was the one getting the \"extra person\" then Id have to be the one to approach him, this seemed pretty fair so i didnt mind aha.\n\ni figured the best way to approach him would be at the end of the night so at about half 2 everything was winding down and i decided to make my move. I told my boyfriend to go to the toilet so i could dance with his friend and as he left he asked him to \"look after me and make sure i was okay\"\n\nsuffice to say it took about 2/3 minutes max for us to end up kissing and he was running his hands all over my body. my boyfriend came back and tapped him on the shoulder, he freaked out! you shouldve seen the look on his face, he looked terrified until my boyfriend just said that he didnt have to worry, but now hed got me all worked up so clearly he had to come home with us to finish the job.\n\nas soon as we got in i dropped to my knees and took out his cock, it was weird being knelt down with two dicks in my face, that probably wasnt a highlight haha\n\nbut being bent over by your boyfriend and sucking a stranger's dick at the same time definitely was :P and then they swapped over, with me riding the guy instead.\n\nafter about half an hour of swapping around (we didnt do anal, i dont mind it i was just a bit shy at the thought of doing it with a stranger) i was bent over with my boyfriend in front of me and his friend behind me when his friend pulled out and came on my ass probably about 3 seconds before my boyfriend came in my mouth. \n\nIt was the perfectly timed finish to the perfect session :P ahah", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rvlj"}, {"score": 44, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/3673z7/the_button_is_like_a_terminal_illness_and_were/", "id": "t3_3673z7", "author": "zeptimius", "title": "The Button is like a terminal illness and we're now at the bargaining stage", "timecreated": 1431807695.0, "subreddit": "thebutton", "selftext": "Please, Button, let me make it to 1,000,000 presses...\n\nPlease, Button, let me make it to June...\n\nEtc", "subreddit_id": "t5_36buk"}, {"score": 23, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Aleague/comments/367uqn/game_day_fire_up/", "id": "t3_367uqn", "author": "Nos_4r2", "title": "GAME DAY!!!!

I am desperately lonely and I love him deeply - don't want to move on.  \n\n\n**About him:**  Very charismatic, handsome, talented musician. His mother is very overbearing, his father is an alcoholic, pretty well absent from his life since parent's divorce at age 12, he suspects his mother is a narcissist and there is a level of co-dependency.  Works an unfulfilled/underpaid job doing 12 hr shifts days and nights.  I suspect he may be bipolar due to mood swings, seasonal depression, self-aggrandizing speeches when drunk.  \n\n\n**About me:**  Somewhat successful career (manager level) but unsatisfied since I've always wanted to do something creative, also drowning in student debt.  I am the oldest child from a large, close Irish-Catholic family.  I have suffered social anxiety and OCD spectrum compulsions since preschool.  I still have self-doubt, despite being conventionally very attractive and outwardly seeming healthy.  I have very few friends, mostly just close with family which does upset me.  \n\n\nAbout us:  Together for 7 years, known each other longer.  We are each other's best friends.  We lived together for the past 3 years in the house I bought and we have a cat and a dog together.  In terms of interests, ours overlap a lot, but we were both guilty of letting each other get into a rut where we just didn't try or do anything.  We still had sex regularly (about 1x/week).  \n\n\n**The breakup/aftermath**:  He broke it off over the phone after a freakout a few days prior over the general lack of satisfaction with his life.  We didn't see each other for a week while he stayed at his mother's place.  Then, he came to take the pets for a few days.  It was awkward and I started to cry at the distance I felt between us.  \n\n\nWe maintained a phone relationship where I learned he felt like I was holding him back from doing the things he wanted to do in his life (ouch!).  He wants to write music and tour, and make new friends every night.  I've always told him I supported him doing this but he has never done it.  He also wants to sleep with other people, which is not because he doesn't find me attractive or love me, but he does feel like he falls in love with every new girl he meets.  He hasn't cheated on me either.  The part about friends made me feel the worst, due to my latent social anxiety.\n\n\nCut to 2 weeks ago, when he came to pick up some stuff and the pets - he was supposed to show up in the afternoon but didn't show up until 9 that night, with some booze and junk food.  We ended up sleeping together 3 times and it was hot, although unprotected (Eek!) and I cried afterwards 2 of those times (double eek!)\n\n\nSince then, he has been more distant (which is partly because I raised concerns about my ability to move on while in contact).  It's been very painful - like a death of a family member.  Unfortunately, I've still had to see him several times due to the pets.  He also still has a ton of shit that he hasn't picked up yet.  \n\n\nI was not concerned with marriage, but I always thought we would spend our lives together - we really are the best friends and can talk about anything.  I thought we were both unhappy with our situation, but it was a mutual agreement.  I even suggested before the breakup that we move to LA together and live our dream lives.  I am having difficulty seeing this ending as a good thing for either of us.  He is now back with his mother (save a few short-lived stints in school and NZ, he lived with her until age 26 - when he moved in with me) and I am becoming my isolated self again.  \n\n\n\n To make matters worse, he has basically said straight up that he is confused and things have not gotten better for him yet like he thought they would.  He's also said he's not interested in getting with anyone else (except for sex??).   But!  He still doesn't want to get back together.  Plus, what about the pets? \n\n   \n\n**tl;dr**: Still love my ex, he wants to sleep with others, we are each other's best friends, our lives are intertwined and much to be worked out yet.

He'd chase him around the room when I'd let them out, and force him to hide in the corners. He'd pick fights both in and out of the cage, with a lot of puffed-up fur, chattering, and side-facing (I'm told this is a major sign of aggression).

I'm currently looking for a qualified vet to do a neuter. How much can I expect to pay for the procedure?

I\u2019m sorry it has been so long. You must be parched! Here\u2019s the T on the ball, I don\u2019t know what this Hello Kitty nonsense is, but the real Top 5 is very different from this counterfeit bs Logo has been airing. To refresh your memories, the Top 5 is Violet, Trixie, Tempest, Katya, and Sasha. Kennedy was eliminated after breaking her leg during a glorious but poorly executed death drop. A mysterious crow has been living in the workroom for several days.\n\nWhich brings us to the mini challenge! Ru walks in and announces that the mini challenge is to do puppets. Violet picks the Tempest puppet, Tempest picks the Trixie puppet, Trixie picks the Sasha puppet, Sasha picks the Katya puppet, and Katya gets the Violet puppet.\n\nViolet makes jokes about how Tempest is old. Tempest slathers her Trixie puppet in foundation and powder. Trixie impersonates Sasha impersonating Ms. Fame, which is weird. Sasha does a good job of Katya, and makes a meth joke. Katya fills the Violet puppet with her own shit, and then just squeezes it out during the performance. Katya wins.\n\nRu announces the main challenge! It is not a Hello Kitty ball, but the Poke Ball! Each designer will be assigned a type and must create three outfits: Pokemon Trainer, Gym Leader Realness, and Monster Couture.  Trixie gets Fairy, Tempest gets Ghost, Sasha gets Poison, Violet gets Bug, and Katya gets Ice. I wonder why these types were assigned! \n\nThey get to work! Tempest is sure in her talents as a seamstress, but Purple questions her taste level. Katya and Purple get to work. Sasha is nervous because she doesn\u2019t know how to do anything. Katya helps her out with some things.\n\nRu announces that there will be a twist! Along with their three looks, they must also create a new Eevee evolution for Nintendo! They are given a white Eevee fursuit and must dye it and decorate it. Amazing! What ever will they do?\n\nSasha is worried about this look. She doesn\u2019t know what a Poison Type evolution of Eevee would look like! Katya suggests Shiteon, a toxic Eevee that\u2019s covered in shit and shits everywhere. Sasha doesn\u2019t like that idea. She decides to maybe reference RDR6 star Laganja Estranja and make Ganjeon, because marijuana is poisonous. Tempest tears her Eevee apart and Trixie shaves hers, while Purple cuts hers in half. What are they going to do?\n\nWe can\u2019t be allowed to see more than 5 minutes of the workroom, so time for the runway! Sasha\u2019s trainer look is cute. It\u2019s a leather jacket and a purple skirt. Her hair is brown and has pigtails. Trixie\u2019s trainer look is also cute, she also does the pigtails but she wears a pink sundress covered in bows. She also wears a straw hat and has a stuffed Jigglypuff on her shoulder. Her look is pretty cute.\n\nViolet\u2019s trainer is great. Her hair is in a dark green bob that covers her eyes, and she wears a tight, well fitted suit. It\u2019s great. Tempest is too old to pull off a baby\u2019s first pokemon journey look, but she tries. She wears a little black dress and straight hair. Not a good look. It reminds me of Coco Montrese\u2019s unfortunate Pink Disaster. Katya wears a parka and Russian hat and looks extremely cute. She tries to ride a bike down the runway and falls off. It\u2019s great.\n\nSasha\u2019s Gym Leader isn\u2019t great. It\u2019s a purple gown with bubbles on it. Very knock off Lady Gaga. Her hair is a cute top bun with spines in it. That\u2019s cute at least. Trixie\u2019s Leader look is pretty good. It\u2019s a pink pantsuit, very safe. A crow, painted pink and with a cute afro glued on, sits on her shoulder.\n\nViolet\u2019s Gym Leader is also excellent. She\u2019s dressed as a beekeeper with a white leather catsuit and a gorgeous white wide brimmed hat with a lace veil. It\u2019s really wonderful. Tempest wears a long purple tattered gown, with geisha inspired hair and makeup. It\u2019s very pretty. She rigs up some ghosts to a headdress so that they spin around her.\n\nKatya\u2019s gym leader is great. She wears a floor length light blue faux fur coat, a blonde bob, and white sunglasses. It\u2019s very glamorous and beautiful. She hires a Zamboni to cover the runway in ice so that she can ice skate down. There is a brief pause, as Ru gets the janitors to clean it up.\n\nThen, they show their Eevee looks. A stuffed Pikachu signals his approval or disapproval. Sasha went with Ganjeon. Ganjeon has marijuana leaves coming out of its head and is bright green. Its legs are everything! Sasha tries to death drop but the fursuit isn\u2019t flexible enough. Pikachu is concerned.\n\nTrixie creates Plasteon. She shaves the entire fursuit and covered it in lacquer, so it looks plastic. It\u2019s bright pink, and she drew on her signature makeup. There are also hinges added on the joints. It\u2019s super cute. Pikachu is confused.\n\nViolet\u2019s is amazing. She ripped out the middle of the suit and added a super tight corset for a wasp wasit, and added a shell like structure to that. It looks like Sasha\u2019s lobster dress if it was very tightly corseted. It\u2019s called Waspeon. It also has antennae and compound eyes. It\u2019s really amazing. Pikachu likes that.\n\nTempest creates Zombeon. It\u2019s dark green with read eyes and there are chunks bitten out of it. It\u2019s drooling and missing teeth. It\u2019s scary and pretty cool. Pikachu is scared but enthralled.\n\nKatya has made Metheon. The mane is covered in giant crystals and she holds and enormous meth pipe as she walks down the runway. It doesn\u2019t have any teeth. She scampers off stage. Pikachu licks his lips and blinks rapidly.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for their Monster Couture! Sasha\u2019s Poison look is very pretty; it\u2019s purple and presumably inspired by Koffing, because are holes in it, and an Ekans face is painted on the midriff. It\u2019s cute I guess. Trixie\u2019s look is inspired by Mr. Mime, and that\u2019s all we are going to say about that.\n\nViolet once again cinches her waist to perfection, wearing a black and yellow corset and catsuit. Her elbows and knees have very sharp drills on them.It\u2019s similar to her Eevee look, but still sickening. Very Beedrill. Tempest is purple and covered in spines and tatters. It\u2019s cool. It looks like Gengar, kind of. Katya wears a long, light blue gown, with a matching turban and holds an ice cream cone. She licks it and then shoves it up her ass. \n\nTime for critiques. The judges don\u2019t like Sasha\u2019s looks, they\u2019re all too simple. They do like Ganjeon but don\u2019t like that she fell back on referencing another queen. Trixie gets mixed critiques. They don\u2019t like the Eevee. They\u2019re uncomfortable with Mr. Mime, but the crow shoots them a nasty look whenever they\u2019re too critical. They are afraid of the crow.\n\nViolet gets amazing reviews. They love everything. Tempest is not well liked; they like the gym leader and monster looks, but the trainer look is among the ugliest the show has ever seen and the Eevee is inappropriately scary. They love Katya\u2019s perfect combination of glamour and comedy.\n\nThey deliberate! During untucked, Trixie reveals that getting critiqued for the Eevee look was hard, because she herself is a furry and prides herself on her fursuiting skill. Sasha thinks that\u2019s kind of hot. Katya performs gymnastics and makes strange sounds.\n\nThey are called back to the mainstage. Surprise! They will be judged as teams. But they weren\u2019t in teams, you might say. Who cares! Katya wins alone, because she wasn\u2019t in a team. Yay for Mom! Trixie and the crow are in the bottom together because the crow underperformed.\n\nThe song is Hello Kitty, by Avril Lavigne. The crow flies around and flaps its wings. Trixie does a good lip sync with some fun charades and good dance moves. She falls into the splits, which no one knew she could do! Ru picks the crow as the winner, and Trixie sashays away. The crow explodes into a billion brilliant lights. \n\nWe have reached the final four! Ru announces that budget cuts have cut the season short, and this season will have a Top Four. The fan vote will decide the winner, who will be announced at the reunion. Who will win?

And yet, soon you'll see that all the warning signs were there. I just couldn't see them.\n\nThis isn't really a post about my [m, late-30s] marriage. (I'm divorcing at the moment due to my wife's [f, late-30s] serial cheating.)\n\nI have had the same best friend [m, now late-30s] since I was about 16. He's a great guy in many respects: clever, witty, knowledgeable, generally loyal, and in some ways child-like, and we've had some great times over the years. I've regularly been his shoulder to lean on, and he's been mine too from time to time. Loyalty is a big thing to me, and I thought I had a buddy for life in him. He's my bro. I would have gladly given my life for him.\n\nHe's been seeing his girlfriend [f, now late-30s] since about 2003. About 2005 he began hanging out with a lot of people from big law firms, and he became a bit snobby. He didn't hang out with me as much as before (previously he'd be at our place every second day and would often sleep on our couch one a week or so after a particularly fun night), but he still made time to see me once a week or so.\n\nHe's always been a cheater. I never have. I know of about a dozen times he's done it, including cheating on his current girlfriend. He always regrets it in the morning, and it's always been one-night stands. He's never tried to start a romantic relationship on the side.\n\nI'm genuinely ashamed to say that I've agreed to cover for him a few times. I'd get a call at 8am asking me to say he'd been at my house if his girlfriend asked. I did it (a) because he was my bro, (b) because I knew he wasn't going to start a new relationship or leave his girlfriend and (c) because I'd never knowingly been cheated on and didn't realize how awful it was. I'd tell him off for it, but I know that isn't enough.\n\nBy about 2006 he and his girlfriend were very serious and thinking about babies.\n\nIn about 2008 he came to see me at work in a distraught state. He told me that he'd tested positive for chlamydia, which he thought he must have got from a girl at a party 6 months earlier. He was worried because he said he knew that his girlfriend would leave him if she found out. He also said that he knew chlamydia could destroy a woman's fertility. He claimed to be suicidal.\n\nI am a fixer. He wanted me to sort the problem out. I told him repeatedly that he should tell his girlfriend. He wouldn't. I sorted the problem out for him. I got him a generous supply of the antibiotic that is the standard treatment for chlamydia infection. I told him that if she hadn't taken the drug within 3 days I was going to ring his girlfriend and tell her. I yelled at him for what he'd done.\n\nHe ended up adulterating her food with it. He abstained from sex for long enough not to re-infect her, then began having sex with her frequently again after he was tested clear of the disease. Then after a few months he had himself re-tested - to test her by proxy. The results were all clear.\n\nHe got promoted in his law firm and gradually became more distant from me. I'm sure some of that was the pressure of his work. When we were together, he'd only want to talk about the boring politics of the law firm. For some reason, he kept me and his law-firm buddies separate. (I think my anarchic attitude, which had endeared me to him in his student days, had come to embarrass him.)\n\nI discovered that my wife had had one-night stand, and discovered what an awful thing cheating really is, in 2012. I talked to him about it. He seemed very embarrassed, and said that maybe I should leave her (which I didn't want to do at the time). He didn't really give any reasons.\n\nIn 2014 I discovered that my wife's liaisons were with at least 7-10 other men throughout virtually the entire duration of our relationship. (I decided not to stay in the relationship after hearing that.) I also discovered that my best friend had known about one of these (in about 2005). I confronted him with what I knew, and he admitted it. He was sheepish, and ultimately acknowledge that he should have told me about it, and he apologized. He stopped talking to my wife after that.\n\nIt's worth noting that he knew of this when he came to me with the chlamydia problem. It also appears my wife told him what she did in an effort to initiate a liaison with him, but that he did not take her up on the offer. (That had been her MO on other occasions.)\n\nHe and his girlfriend have just had a baby. They had it through IVF. I don't know what necessitated the IVF. It may well have been something entirely unrelated to chlamydia.\n\nI love my friend, but I don't know whether he cares about me. And I know that he knows that I know that it would destroy his relationship, and now his young family, if I told his girlfriend about the chlamydia. So, to the extent that he is nice to me, and to the extent to which he's apologized, I don't know whether that's because he cares about me or because he is afraid of me.\n\nIt gets more complicated. His girlfriend is Facebook-friends with a man whose partner also cheated on him with one of the (other) men my wife cheated on me with. That partner also encouraged my wife to cheat on me with this man.\n\nTo top it all off, my best friend's father is my former boss, my close friend of 20 years and my divorce lawyer.\n\n**What should I do?**\n\nWhat (if anything) can I ethically do that preserves my relationship with my best friend and his father?", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x8ez"}, {"score": 2087, "url": "http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/05/elizabeth-warren-ascendant", "id": "t3_365tvp", "author": "TropicsM", "title": "Elizabeth Warren ascendant: A choice not an echo; \"Ms Warren has emerged as a commanding and articulate standard-bearer for the liberal wing of the liberal party\"", "timecreated": 1431780586.0, "subreddit": "politics", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq"}, {"score": 21, "url": "http://imgur.com/AQpHR4P", "id": "t3_3686el", "author": "adam_of_adun", "title": "My first Jeep!", "timecreated": 1431830373.0, "subreddit": "Jeep", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4jn"}, {"score": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3686l5/reddit_what_rule_have_you_always_used_as_a/", "id": "t3_3686l5", "author": "s0m3th1ngUn0r1g1n4l", "title": "Reddit, what rule have you always used as a guideline to live your life?", "timecreated": 1431830477.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "I have always heard The Golden Rule, \"do onto others..\" What rule or code do you live by?", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/365w5i/couples_of_reddit_do_you_and_your_so_wake_up_at/", "id": "t3_365w5i", "author": "GRANDMASTER_", "title": "Couples of Reddit.

But I wanted to bust out this episode of the short-lived TV series Geek Love, because it contained some hidden redpill truths that serve as a good real world example for those of us just beginning to get unplugged.\n\nThe premise of the show is nerdy guys and girls trying to speed date at a convention known as Comic Con. [The very first episode featured the lowest omega male who has ever graced the planet: Alex the Brony.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ5iwGApwLM) He's a rotund mutton-chopped Naruto-hat wearing man who describes himself as foreveralone. And in two seconds, it's easy to see why. He is the definition of a neckbeard.\n\nBut... as you watch the episode, notice the reaction from the girls. Women love to talk about how they're so enlightened and non-shallow when it comes to guys, but watch at their animal brains physically shrinking in revulsion as they come upon Alex.\n\n**2:52 - 3:38** : Alex is meekly discussing his speed dating plans with two attractive female friends. As soon as they learn he wants to to find love, they rip him apart with insults and derision. They make fun of him for being a brony, call him a creep to his face, and generally laugh at the notion that he hopes to ever get touched by a woman.\n\n**5:39, 5:48 6:06**: These were the nuclear bombs of female disinterest. Every girl Alex talked to was viscerally repelled by him, but you can notice it easiest in these three examples. Note the looks in their eyes; they are uncomfortable just being there with him because he doesn't possess any alpha traits. Even though he's a perfectly nice person and unthreatening, they hate the thought of being associated with him for even 3 minutes.\n\nFinally, Alex finds a girl who supposedly likes him - but even she rejects him as soon as the cameras stop rolling. The sad end that's common among all omegas.\n\nThis should serve as the nail in the coffin of the idea that \"nerdy girls are more open-minded!\" No. All women want the dominant male in a pack, even geeky women. Sure, they may not go for a football player or alpha politician but they want the strongest, tallest, most muscular guy in the computer science lecture hall. It all boils down to masculinity, *no matter what environment you're in*. AWALT. AWALT.

This new wave of artists that seems to be coming out of Mac Millers basement has been steadily impressing for a couple years now and they don't seem to be stopping... With Doris sounding a bit all over the place to a lot of people, this album brought it all together under a dark and gritty, but chill umbrella and I think the features helped a lot with that. I'm gonna work with those collabs and try to suggest artists that relate to this album and what I believe to be it's sound, which is a mix of dark, rough and violent themes and mellow/warm sounds (kinda like being high af on the couch)\n\n* **Da$H**\n\nHe has close ties with A$AP and was featured on [Grown Ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSDoYK3qDzo), he's also Dame Dashes nephew. He's released a few mixtapes, [V.I.C.E.S](http://www.audiomack.com/album/hz-global/vices) being my favourite and has a style similar to Action Bronson (can have fun in his raps) but much darker and more gangsta at times. Also collaborates with RetcH on [That Time We Smoked Dust](http://www.audiomack.com/album/hz-global/the-time-we-smoked-dust) & [La Cineaga](http://www.datpiff.com/DaH-RetcH-La-Cienega-mixtape.398656.html).\n\n* **Wiki** (& Ratking)\n\nWiki is part of the NY rap trio Ratking and was featured on [AM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiwHmHdd4Xg). He has very gritty, rough raps that scream New York. His verse on Earls album reminds me of his description of some of his music as \"a scraped knee\". Ratking have a pretty experimental sound but it works more than it doesn't. [So It Goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAWzCmkJqpc) & [700-Fill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oT4zK85Dog) are their only two albums but they bring a lot of variety (not very similar to these artists but they're too good not to suggest).\n\n* **Vince Staples**\n\nFeatured on [Wool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJh9sN-xPzI) on the album, Earl fans have probably already heard of Vince before but I wrote him off kinda early as just a horror rapper (very stupidly) and since then he's come out with *a lot* of amazing stuff. He's a gangsta rapper from Long Beach but he brings so much more. Definitely check Shyne Coldchain Vol. [1](http://mixtapemonkey.com/357/vince-staples-shyne-coldchain-vol-1) & [2](http://www.datpiff.com/Vince-Staples-Shyne-Coldchain-Vol-2-mixtape.590712.html), Hell Can Wait & Stolen Youth. His music is often much more serious than Da$H/RetcH/Bronson/Mac.\n\n* **RetcH**\n\nNot actually featured on the album (although he gets a shoutout on there somewhere) but he's a great rapper from New Jersey that is in The H'z with Da$H and also goes by Retchy P. He has a few projects I really enjoy, [Polo Sporting Goods](https://www.audiomack.com/album/onethrone/polo-sporting-goods) (for the legendary [Special Jim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amxYMsowqFc)), [Delinquents & Degenerates](http://www.datpiff.com/RetcH-Delinquents-Degenerates-mixtape.406784.html) & (mentioned before) La Cineaga with Da$H. Definitely check out [Blue Fin Tuna ft. Da$H](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qqgqq9zqnk) & [Hunnit Bandz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVqSL02ogpo) (gets his Q on).\n\n^^^^'\n\n^*These ^guys ^aren't ^really ^slept ^on ^but ^they're ^relevant ^to ^the ^discussion*\n\n* **Mac Miller**\n\nMac seems to be the dude with the studio that brings all these people together to make this shit. No need to talk much about him but Delusional Thomas & Faces definitely have a similar feel to this album. [New Faces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuJPkQkhwn8) is an awesome track by Mac featuring Earl & Da$H.\n\n* **Ab Soul**\n\nAlso not featured on the album but he is featured on a lot of tracks with these guys and brings top notch lyricism (when he wants to, potty boo) but I'm only gonna suggest a couple tracks since he's pretty well known. [Short $ermons w/ RetcH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAaelzDUds), [The End is Near w/ Mac Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuZ1Jtrij_s), [Ride Slow w/ Danny Brown & Delusional Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzwY6s1yQjQ).\n\n* **Action Bronson**\n\nAction has worked with most of these artists and brings a fun energy to his raps. His Blue Chips (1 & 2) mixtapes are probably closest (imo) to these artists but his whole discog is great. His collabs include [Flip Ya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzRhTkeB31E) ft. RetcH, [Twin Peugots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZEN9qF-HGQ) ft. Mac Miller & Big Body Bes, [Warlord Leather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOPyZTFLcPw) ft. Earl Sweatshirt, [Scandanavian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzP9jYUusVY) Detours - Da$H ft. Action Bronson, [Elimination Chamber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVkgUYARWao) - Domo ft. Action Bronson, Vince Staples & Earl\n\n^^^^'\n\n\nThere's a few tracks that bring a few of these kinda artists together too,\n\n^^^^'\n\n[Whale - Da$H ft. Ab Soul & RetcH \\(Prod.

This was more a mental exercise to see how far a theory could be pushed and still kinda sorta make sense. \n\nThis is based off the \"Selitos is the Cthaeh, and the Lackless box holds the mountain glass he used to stab his eye out, and is keeping him in the tree\" theory. Be warned, this is a lot of speculation. :-P \n\nThe Creation war was Shapers vs Namers, or Lanre vs Selitos. Good friends growing up - in fact, Lanre married a Namer. But Selitos gained too much power in mastering Naming, and became corrupt. \nLanre, a Shaper, was part of the creators of the Faen realm, created to trap Selitos, and as an experiment to see what powers Shapers could bear. But they had to use existing matter. They were Shapers, not Creators. So they split the world into mortal and Faen. Selitos didn't know the names of things in the Faen realm, and was pretty much powerless there. \nBut, Selitos was able to convert the Sithe to his cause, and they became the Amyr. Lanre/Haliax gave the object which trapped Selitos/the Cthaeh in the tree (Because Lanre wasn't a Namer, he had to shape a trap) in the Fae realm to the Lackless family. The trap? The Lackless box, or the representation of the Cthaeh's tree in the mortal world. But, because Lanre wasn't a Namer, he wasn't able to completely trap Selitos (the piece of the moon story) . Selitos is trying, still, to put the world back together (destroying the Faen realm, a broken house he is trapped in), but Lanre/Haliax is trying to prevent it. Lanre is looking for the box. He lost it. But he has to make sure Selitos doesn't find out what he's looking for, so he destroys anyone who discovers what he's up to. You see, the Seven have taken it upon themselves to carry out the work of the Sithe as it was intended, by destroying anything that the Cthaeh/Selitos affected. \n\nSkarpi, the Amyr, and others are keeping Kvothe alive in even the most challenging of situations because he can open the box.

A round baby face with  Milky porcelain smooth skin. She is  very innocent looking, and she uses that to her advantage.\n\n\n**Personality**: She thinks she is better then every one and every thing, and she will say it to your face. She is manipulative, cunning and quite calculating. She enjoys the power she feels from stepping on, and crushing people who try to cross her.  She feels broken if she is not in control, and she will do ANY THING, to regain that control. Her mentality leans closer to the Razi side of her mothers family, where the Van Droombeelds are quite contemporary for a strict pureblood family.\n\n\n**Background**:The daughter of Yolanda Van Droombeeld-Barbanov, of the New York Van Droombeeld's, and Leroy Goode, of the Rhode Island Goode's. She was raised in Westchester NY around many of her cousins. Yolanda was a very well known socialite, Leroy was the best father he could, but he was a weak man, and really had no idea what he was doing. He spoiled the children, and had a team of nannies instead of having to deal with them.  When Lillica was ten, the family moved to London, for treatment of a medical issue Yolanda suffered. Almost immediately Lillica left London and enrolled at Durmstrang, refusing to have any thing to do with her mother. She has since agreed to go to Hogwarts to be closer to her family, while her brother wanted to stay at Durmstrang. Anyone who knows Lillica well enough, would say the act of good faith on her part, agreeing to go to Hogwarts, was very out of character. They might also say, there would have to be an alterer motive behind as well. \n\n\nLillica is a very manipulative, crazy perfectionist Queen Bee type. She has dreams of great power and she is just a little bit evil. She doesn't care about her mothers issues, and believes that her mother deserves it, since abandoning her and her brother emotionally since they were little. She is a very well known pureblood elitist. Her Great-Grand Parents are Yolanda Van Droombeeld and Helmouth Razi, both on her mothers side. Though her fathers family is quite notable, and pureblood. She dislikes how weak of a man he is, and rarely associates with his side of the family.   \n\n\n---\n\n\n*Lillica stood in the doorway to the large castle, looking out at the grounds, everything about her, every precise tiny detail was perfect. The gold waves flowing down her shoulders, not a single hair out of place. The silver headband, almost perfectly crowning her like a tiara. The ballet flats she wore, the only truly sensible shoe for so much stone of the castle.*\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ygix"}, {"score": 13, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/35ri8j/imagine_world_xi_vs_south_africa/", "id": "t3_35ri8j", "author": "ViolatingBadgers", "title": "Imagine: World XI vs South Africa!", "timecreated": 1431469369.0, "subreddit": "Cricket", "selftext": "Let's say another World Test XI has been announced to play the best test team in the world, South Africa.

I finished the Ray Lewis set and played some games with him and want to pass the information along to my fellow MUTers.\n\n**Run Stopping** 98 block shed is no joke. I have played about 5 games with him and have yet to get a red \"failed shed\" with him. He can single-handedly eat up inside runs, and can beat a guard to the edge to end strong power with ease. He has caused 3 fumbles and 2 injuries to HBs so far. \n\n10/10 *\"The anti-Bo Jackson\"*\n\n**Pass Rush** Runs like a DB hits like Ray Lewis, hide yo wife hide yo kids, this guy cannot be blocked. I can drop him in coverage over the middle, see the roll-out cheese coming & still make it to the QB in time to rush him. 94 speed/ 98 accel with his block shed is unparalleled in this game.\n\n10/10 *\u201cAmerica is all about speed. Hot, nasty, badass speed.\u201d- Will Ferrel*\n\n**Usering** 94 speed. 3 picks in 5 games so far. The epitome of a \"bait\" LB. QB thinks you left the receiver and Ray Ray swarms in to pick it off at the last second. Seriously, I said it earlier, but he's like a DB moving around the field snatching up errant throws. If somebody catches one under you, 100 tackle coupled with 99 HP, ain't nobody picking up those extra yards on 4th down. Besides the Boss version of this man, nobody is more fun to user. I've loved my moments with AR Mosely but he cannot compare to the murder-er-umm... legend that is Five-Two.\n\n12/10 *\u201cWhen the Fox hears the Rabbit scream he comes a-runnin', but not to help.\u201d \n\u2015 Thomas Harris, The Silence of the Lambs*\n\n**AI Controlled** I'll note this, I usered him all but about 10 snaps so I can't speak too much for this, but 100 PRC 95AWR can. He don't need you. He can do bad all by himself, but then why would ya let him?    ROBOTS!\n\n*\u201cThe Three Laws of Robotics:*\n\n*1: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm;*\n\n*2: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law;*\n\n*3: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law:*\n\n*The Zeroth Law: A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.\u201d*\n\n**TL;DR You cannot have more fun on D than with this man.

Let\u2019s talk about the chemistry of firearms.\n\nIntroduction\n\nI\u2019m Suzanne Bell, Associate Professor of Chemistry and Forensic Science at West Virginia University. I teach and conduct research in analytical and forensic chemistry and work with students from undergraduate through PhD. I joined the faculty here in 2003.  Prior to then, I worked for the New Mexico State Police Crime Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Eastern Washington University. My PhD is from New Mexico State University.\n\nI am a past member of the Scientific Working Group for Seized Drug Analysis (SWGDRUG) and a current member of the Scientific Working Group for Gunshot Residue (SWGGSR) and the gunshot residue subcommittee of NIST\u2019s Organization of Scientific Area Committees (OSAC).  I am also a commission on the National Commission on Forensic Science (NCFS) and the Forensic Education Programs Accreditation Commission (FEPAC).\n\nWhen a gun is fired, a wealth of chemical and physical evidence is produced. This residue is deposited on surfaces near the shooter including then hands. The chemical evidence is a complex combination ranging from tiny particulates containing heavy metal oxides and sulfides, particles of burnt and partially burnt propellant, and condensed gases. Each type of evidence can be characterized analytically and used to help answer key forensic questions such as who did (or did not) fire the weapon.\n\nI will be speaking at an upcoming webinar with the American Chemical Society on Thursday, May 14 at 2pm ET. Everyone is welcome to join: http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/events/upcoming-acs-webinars/gunshot-chemistry.html\n\nI am ready to answer your questions about forensic chemistry and how we apply it in shooting cases.\n\nResources and weblinks:\n\nNCFS: http://www.justice.gov/ncfs\nFEPAC: http://fepac-edu.org/\nSWGGSR: http://www.swggsr.org/\nOSACS: http://www.nist.gov/forensics/osac/\nWVU Chemistry: http://chemistry.wvu.edu/\nWVU Forensic and Investigative Sciences: http://forensics.wvu.edu/\n\n\nI'll be back at 12 pm EDT (9 am PDT, 5 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!\n\nGlad to see all the questions appearing.

I don\u2019t work with the markings that are imparted to bullets or cartridges or comparing bullets to weapons.  I am familiar with these areas and will offer comments as appropriate but I am not a court qualified expert in these fields.\n\nI will \u201csee\u201d you all at noon.\n\n\nGood afternoon (or morning, depending on where you are).

We can choose a yeast that is more fruity, more spicy, or a mix of the two.  Here are the choices...\n\n**Omega OYL500 - Saisonsteins Monster**  \nThis strain is a genetic hybrid resulting from the mating of a French Saison and Belgian Saison yeast  Created by and available exclusively from Omega Yeast. Less phenolic and more fruit character than French Saison. Exhibits some of the bubble gum character of Belgian Saison.\n\n**White Labs WLP568 - Belgian Style Saison Ale Blend**  \nThis blend melds Belgian style ale and saison strains. The strains work in harmony to create complex, fruity aromas and flavors. The blend of yeast strains encourages complete fermentation in a timely manner. Phenolic, spicy, earthy, and clove like flavors are also created.\n\n**Wyeast 3711 - French Saison**  \nA very versatile strain that produces Saison or farmhouse style beers that are highly aromatic (estery), peppery, spicy and citrusy. This strain enhances the use of spices and aroma hops, and is extremely attenuative but leaves an unexpected silky and rich mouthfeel.\n\n**[PLEASE GO HERE TO VOTE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bGc6lKI2QrmEmsR8bM7h5IdcxwH-Su7vMC51sG4_0AU/viewform?usp=send_form)** | We'll run this for 5 days then choose our next option.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**BREWDAY AND BOTTLE SHARE DATE**  \n**Saturday 06/06 starting at 1PM** at Schoolhouse Beer and Brewing in Marietta.

This is going to be a wall of text.\n\nMy puppy, I say puppy but he's eleven or twelve now, is a black Spanador named [Twister](http://imgur.com/a/MwGhV). He's got a crooked star on his chest, like someone drew a line down the center and shifted the right half down by three inches. Spanadors, Cocker spaniel-Labrador mixes, are \"designer breeds\" that no one tries to get. No one breeds them on purpose. The friendly lab gets frisky with the handsome spaniel next door and boom. They're inexact, some look more like one breed or the other. My baby is a lab perma-puppy with giant eyes and longer ears. \n\nWe won him, the shelter pulled names out of a hat because he was the only young dog there. Six months old, found on a highway during a thunderstorm with a collar and a leash but no tags. On his first day he ran through a screen door like it wasn't there. We took him to petco and he got so wrapped up in his leash that we had to untangle him. Hence his name.\n\nHe hates water, loves elk jerky and licks my face (only mine. I still don't know why) like it's made of peanut butter. He falls over on your hand when you scratch his ears and flops when he lays down and he curls up on any swatch of blanket that gets on the floor.\n\nHe blocks the floor vent with his butt and whips his tail on my face and is absolutely obnoxious when he wants a treat. He has the worst farts ever and snores like a yeti.\n\nIn October we removed a mass from his mouth. My mother and father, before the culture came back, told me they'd decided they weren't going to do chemo if it was cancer because he's older and it's too expensive. I didn't answer.\n\nAt the dinner table they said it was cancer. They asked my brother first and he agreed with my parents. He didn't know, at the time, that my parents had already decided. Disagreement was a false option. Like when your boss asks you to pick up a shift. I imagine it would feel the same when an officer asks if you want a breathalyzer test. I disagreed anyway. The medication would guarantee, within reason, more time with my pet. My opinion was asked for, yes, but not wanted. I was asked out of courtesy. To be polite, so I would feel included, so I couldn't say I wasn't asked.\n\nI was the minority. I didn't go to the cancer doctor, not when there were options that I couldn't take and was overruled on.\n\nI tried. I have no legal right, but I tried. I yelled until I couldn't speak, reasoned until logic didn't exist, pleaded with everything I had. I offered everything, every dollar I had, every piece of credit I could sign up for. Take a loan, spread the story for donations, ask for help. It was futile. I feel certain now that if I had raised a million, I would still have been outvoted. Denied. Ignored. I'm their daughter. I grew up with Twister in my life, and I didn't even warrant an acknowledgement.\n\nTwo weeks ago, it went so far into his lungs. I didn't want to know the prognosis. Dad respected my request. Surprisingly. Mom didn't and told me anyway. My opinion was neither sought after nor wanted. Or offered. No point anymore, the damage is done.\n\nThree days ago he stopped eating. I can get coldcuts and peanut butter and elk jerky into him, but dinners are rejected or vomited. Everything, even people food. Even I've given up on dog food at this point.\n\nTwo hours ago, my mother came into my room and beat around the bush, and then tried to plan my dog's death around my work schedule. I work tomorrow, so I asked her for Friday. Please, just give me one full day with him. Some alone time, at least. Please. \n\nDad has a doctor's appointment. Can't do it Friday, she says. Thursday. Thursday is my day off before I have to work Friday through Monday as a hostess at a children's restaurant. Smiling and talking about goddamn elephants for minimum wage. \n\nI work tomorrow. From 4:30 to about ten pm. \n\nI would've fought, guys. I would've beggared myself, given every last cent in my bank account, driven across the country if necessary, for just a couple months more, one month more, a week, a day, something, please. I would've at least tried to save my best friend, my baby I've grown up with. Every time I look at him, all I see what I could've done, what I would've done for a member of my family. I can't face him. Play with him, she said. Get out of your room and come downstairs and play with him. But how the hell do I do that, when she's right there watching me play with him and I have to look my mother in the face and hide this, this rage? She could've done something. They both could have. It wasn't so expensive that they couldn't have handled it. My job is minimum wage, but his is nowhere near that. I would've dealt with an old laptop for college. I could deal with a burner phone and a budget grocery list. Generic medications, fine. I don't care that I couldn't go out anywhere. I would've done anything, literally anything for my dog, my friend in pain.\n\nI don't know what to do or where to move or how to function. It will be worse tomorrow. And worse than that the next day. \n\nI can't even imagine the existence of Friday. I'm dreading it, Reddit, please. Please say something because all I want to do is make the world stop turning or steal Twister and run. Whatever works. I'm sorry, I just..really needed this sub. This one, in particular.\n\nIt doesn't really feel any better, but at least my rage is out there. Don't cry and tell me I'm wrong. Don't profess to love him more than I. You could've done something, and you didn't. \n\nYou watched my best friend get sentenced to death, and asked me only when his execution would be convenient. When you had the chance to save him, you didn't lift a finger.\n\nEdits to add a link. If you recognize me by my house or my story or by my sweetie, please ignore me. I don't want to talk to you.\n\nTL;DR My sweet boy has been dying for months, in earnest for weeks. I tried to save him. I was outvoted.

I created The Steaming Wick as a way to share my recipes and deals that used to be a pain in the butt to find when I got started. The steaming wick not only offers affiliated and non-affiliated deals but it also has product reviews of things I buy to try out as an actual vaper, there is also an ejuice recipe section that I am building up of recipes i've made in batches for those looking to save even more money. My goal is to provide as much information to you guys as I can manage to post up and make sure that it is actually useful. We welcome vendors and users to submit deals, recipes, and articles they have written. Out of our affiliate deals I take 50% from those commissions earned and vape stuff forward or do giveaways such as this. I will be able to offer larger giveaways as the usage of the site grows. Reddit has been very kind to me and has helped me curb my addiction to analogs as well as that of my wife. I look forward to more giveaways and helping the community in anyway shape or form that I can.

I read here, that it's not well working on bigger box-sets and the quality will sound shitty as fuck.

The steam-source was on 320kbps but the programm could only rip 256kbps... Is there a program that tells me if the source has really 256 kbps or is it just impossible to define it after the rip?\n* If 256kbps isn't useable, HOW can I get certain mixes (that are not downloadable though any legal source) in a higher quality than 256kbps?\n\nBonus Question:\n\n* If 256 is not enough, is 320 useable in Clubs? Or do I have to get everything in FLAC?\n\nIf anyone may raise the answer, that I cant get those mixes because the performer doesnt want them to be played out of his set: 99% of my 256kbps ripped mixes are also in Spotify, so I doubt that it's a legal question.\n\nI hope there is someone out there before my gig (next weeks Saturday) to tell me about my mixes so i may change my set or get the FLAC Data.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2syix"}, {"score": 4225, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/m0TWOYT.jpg", "id": "t3_34ynr7", "author": "ghost_mv", "title": "[TV] Rewatching series from the start, seeing this in episode two still depresses me...", "timecreated": 1430847053.0, "subreddit": "gameofthrones", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjz2"}, {"score": 13, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CFBOffTopic/comments/350hsw/dc_meetup/", "id": "t3_350hsw", "author": "murgle1012", "title": "DC Meetup?", "timecreated": 1430878273.0, "subreddit": "CFBOffTopic", "selftext": "Not to be outdone by those Austin scrubs, we should do a DC area meetup.

Except that he is creating something that people enjoy, while you are a bunch of good-for-nothings trying to tear down the hard work of people.\n\n> The important part is how Mark Kern feels that he, like many other performers or creators of cultural objects, knows better than the critics. This is a very common position to take. Nobody likes to hear anything but praise, so when faced with criticism, \n\nIsn't it a bit ironic to whine about criticism of your 'criticism'? \n\n> Mark Kern is an example of the type of push-back against criticism which is both expected and common when anybody, scholars, amateurs or professional critics, start looking systematically at any cultural expression and ask more of it than just superficial entertainment. \n\nWait, I thought that you were 'scholars' and that you were trying to study games. From this, it would almost seem that you are trying to push some sort of agenda, and a radical one at that!\n\n> Perhaps it is time, after years of thinking of games as an almost universally good thing and a medium to be defended, to question that truth. Perhaps games, design and gamers aren't so special after all, and need to be studied more as hostile objects resulting from a hostile culture, than as the labour of love it has been to so many of us. \n\nThen don't be surprised when gamers treat you as a hostile force, and when they start questioning the idea that supposedly 'academic' criticism is a universally good thing, as there is clearly a bunch of agenda-driven ideologues trying to corrupt their hobby.\n\nhttps://archive.is/WvKG0\n\nThe whole thing is worth reading. It will give you insight into the demented minds of the Gender Studies crowd. Remember when AGG was freaking out about Gamergate \"destroying gaming\" by making academics lose interest in games? This is why they were so upset. These \"academics\" are ideologues who want to co-opt this medium for their own political agenda. Losing interest means that they're moving on to wreck a medium more receptive to their agenda.", "subreddit_id": "t5_33726"}, {"score": 95, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/36qfbl/best_experience_ever/", "id": "t3_36qfbl", "author": "Kerolusion", "title": "Best Experience Ever", "timecreated": 1432196656.0, "subreddit": "talesfromcallcenters", "selftext": "I have spent near five years working in two different call centers and this particular incident has always been the highlight of it all. \n\nAt this time, I was working for the first one in the CPU department. I was Tier 1 technical support for the computers. I don't remember exactly what was wrong with this man's computer but whatever it was he couldn't get on it to retrieve his files or at least one file in particular. His computer was no longer covered under repair warranty either. We did determine that it was a hardware issue and I felt really bad for this guy. \n\nHe said he was an author and the script for his second novel was on the computer and he did not have it backed up. (I myself am a writer and this is why his plight hit home with me.) So I put him on hold and went to our tier 2 to see if I could get him an exception for getting his computer fixed. I told them the story and what was going on and was denied by two different agents. I was still determined to help this guy, and he was so nice. He waited patiently while he was on hold and was just desperate to get his files and very grateful that I was trying to help him.\n\nSo next I decided, in a last ditch effort, that I was going to try customer relations. I talked to this very nice guy and told him what was up. I pleaded my customers case, told how long the customer had been with us, that he has lots of products, had good case history, and WHY I was trying so hard to get him an exception. And the customer relations agent said sure no problem. I'll get him hooked up. I went back to tell the customer and he was absolutely ecstatic. He asked for my name again and told me when his first book was going to hit stores soon and then when the  second book should if he could get it. He told me he was going to put me into the acknowledgements of that second book. (Which for someone like me made me super giddy.)\n\nI always remember the customers name and the name of his book. It was such an unusual title so it was easy. And about a year and a half later when he'd told me that it should be out, I checked for it and found it on Amazon. I was able to view the acknowledgements section in their little 'preview' option and saw that it has indeed come to be. There I was listed and thanked for my customer service.\n\nCome to think of it...that's probably the best experience I've ever had to date in any job. I even bought a copy of the book later on just because it has my name in. It's like a small trophy for something small yet good I've accomplished in my life XD\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2urem"}, {"score": 276, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/36rolu/meta_post_can_people_stop_writing_click_bait/", "id": "t3_36rolu", "author": "Maplicker", "title": "[Meta Post] Can people stop writing click bait titles?", "timecreated": 1432224831.0, "subreddit": "NoFap", "selftext": "This ain't buzzfeed, announce your successes or failures don't use click baits to get me interested.

I want to discuss 2 items with you guys since new players and normally low skill cap players can understand.\n\nFirst lets talk about Cursed Wand. We all know from personal experience that Cursed Wand is an anti-tank item that fixes the problem with tank abuse in Strife. S2 made it that way since a lot of people don't have the knowledge to buy Titan Slayer when people have health and resistance. This item gives an awesome active effect, but how effective can it be? Well it certainly can blow up tanks and forces them to buy actual survivability items to counter play Cursed Wand. The problem I see with newer players and normal players is that they aren't seeing the bigger picture. How do you beat Cursed Wand users? Well it's simple, there are 4 items in this game that have a higher value of doing the job of beating Cursed Wand. The first one is the Void Key. It's an easy item to used, but make sure you see the Cursed Wand's active effect before using it, or they will just use it right after your Void Key and kill you quick if they have the damage to do so. The down side to Void Key is, if they  try to single you out, who knows how many of their team is behind him/her waiting to all get gold off you. The second item is of course Barrier Token. It gives some degree of resistance when they try to use everything on you, but can also be used to delay their other skills from being used on you for 2 seconds. The down side to Barrier token is that they might just hit you with one skill first to make you waste the effect then team fight right after by force. The 3rd item I will consider would be Spirit Ward, but that's if you're actually a person who builds mana based items which is not a bad thing. Mana based items are and will always be an underated to top and middle class players which I sadly will say. If you have a large max mana pool, it can really soak in the damage from Cursed Wand after math damage. \n\nI saved the biggest impact against Cursed Wand for last, it is of course the Stone Skin. Stone Skin is such an easy way of dealing with Cursed Wand, because it gives you 80 flat reistance. This means that it takes 2 Cursed Wand users to eliminate your Stone Skin bonus stats, but even then your normal resistance stats are still existing, so now it takes a 3rd Cursed Wand user to make you lose Resistance. It forces your opponents to waste an item slot with dealing with your tankiness in team fights and ganking potential, one item slot that could've been a better item to invest in. \n\nYou can combine these 4 items if you choose, in my opinion I normally combine Barrier Token with Stone Skin in the mid game because I know people are going to buy Cursed Wand since SNAX's influence towards the player base is very sadistic-like and very misleading to newer audiences. I would use Void Key if I know my hero is going to get killed in less than a second and Spirit Ward if my build is mana based. \n\nWell, I hope this information helps out this player base since I get quite annoyed with people complaining about easy to deal with things and let me tell you, this game is not hard to comprehend counter play strategies. Everything in this game is balanced and every hero has counters. Just remember, the meta is the items not the heroes. The reason I say this is because when you make a moba where items can be customized into any form of stats, then that eliminates the hero meta meaning no hero is better than most heroes, just a few others due to their skills vs their skills. Heroes are just simply your team composition on how you want to play out the game, nothing more. \n\nSeriously though, I hope this information serves well to the newer people mostly, this was all tested before writing this post.\n\n- http://www.twitch.tv/general_tsuki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ttrn"}, {"score": 9, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/36qejr/serious_why_do_we_care_about_how_long_the_human/", "id": "t3_36qejr", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "[Serious] Why do we care about how long the human species exists for?", "timecreated": 1432195960.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"score": 281, "url": "http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/114/senate/1/183", "id": "t3_36rz63", "author": "zippityhooha", "title": "Sen Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray vote YES to fast-track the TPP", "timecreated": 1432229157.0, "subreddit": "Seattle", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhad"}, {"score": 70, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/36s042/mazal_tov_i_had_a_baby_ama/", "id": "t3_36s042", "author": "cmink79", "title": "Mazal tov!!!

About two weeks ago I answered the phone, and it was a gentleman asking about the cost of tires.\n\nWell this is a standard thing I can do tire quotes easy, and since I know the state tax tables, and other costs of installation fees I can give you total including tax. Which according to everyone I talk to on the phone no one else in town does this. So we make many sales just from being able to give a to the penny cost.  \n\nJumping ahead to the next day the gentleman comes in, and purchases 4 tires. Nothing abnormal about this, he came in around 8 AM, and that was that. About 6 PM I get a call from the gentleman. He was asking some information on the road hazard warrenty he purchased, and some of the cashiers do not explain the coverage so I go over the warrenty information. Coverage does not cover vandalism, or wrecks, or wreckless driving. So curbing the tires is not covered. \n\n   Well he tells me that he was driving home from work when his brakes went out, and he had to ditch the vehicle, or end up in a possible t-bone because he was near a intersection with the major highway through town. I would have done the same. Well I asked if everyone was ok. He said yes, but two of his tires got badly damaged one was torn up out right, and the other had a bad goose egg on the side.\n\n   Well I told him unfortunately this type of damage was not covered under the warrenty. He calmly replied I was afraid of that, and he asks the costs of replacing just the two tires. He did not sound mad at me, and he was pretty calm which we get calls like this from time to time, but usually end in someone yelling at me over the phone. So I decided since he was being nice I would try to go above expectations. So I ask the gentleman to hold while I look up the tires, and cost. He agrees, and I put him on hold.\n\n   So I call up the assistant manager, and tell him what is going on the guy bought 4 tires that morning, and how they were damaged. I tell him normally something like this is not covered, but the man was on the phone, and was not angry, and was inquiring about cost to replace. If we can at least comp one of the tires. Well the manager tells me to do it since I felt compelled enough to even ask to do this, and only one tire since the tires the man got were on the more pricey side. So I switch back over to the line with the gentleman.\n\n   I told the gentleman I was able to get permission to comp one of the tires, and gave him the price for the other. The man was very happy to hear this, and I got his name, and info so when he showed up with the tires to comp the one tire. Which would take him a couple of days to come in because his car was in the shop having his breaks repaired. \n\n   Two days later the gentleman showed up, and I rang up the order, and he told me to thank the person on the phone. I told him that was me he talked to, and he then said I want you to know you have a very kind gentle, and sultry voice on the phone. Well I did not know what sultry meant at the time, and thought it was weird, but said thanks, and he left. I later googled sultry, and now realize that was kind of creepy.\n\n Well I was off work yesterday, and the department manager called me which is unusual. He normally will just text me if he needs me to come in early or later than normal. So I answer my phone figuring somethings hit the fan, and he needs help quick. No luck on that. Apparently the guy called, and asked if I was working yesterday, and the manager told him I was off, and the dude asked him if he could have my home number. The manager refused that. Well he said around two hours later a delivery guy showed up with flowers addressed to me, and the card had a phone number that had the dudes cell phone. As a note I am male also, and happily married.\n\nSo my wife when I told her what happened she just laughed her butt off, and jokingly told me to let me know when the wedding was going to be. So yup I officially have a creepy stalker now. \n\nTL;DR: Was nice to a customer, and now he is sending me flowers at work, and asking people for my phone number. Creeper style.\n\nEDIT: Ok so he showed up again yesterday, and I told him I was not interested. Oddly enough he took it well, and apologized if he seemed a little too forward. He was apparently having a long streak of real bad luck. Apparently he just recently moved into town, and has not had much a good time in doing so as place he was living in recently had a pipe burst, and did some major damage, and he lost alot of his things from the flooding, and the landlord had to get it fixxed, but the damage was real bad, so he is living in a hotel room for 3 weeks while the landlord has people doing the repairs, and he had nails in his tires from somewhere, and was why he originally bought tires that morning, and then his breaks went out on the car. So admittedly he had some shitty luck, and he thought it was getting worse when I told him on the phone warrenty did not cover wreck damage, but I was nice enough to comp, and help him out. I told him I hope his luck gets better.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t2zt"}, {"score": 12, "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/mariners-minor-league-report-may-20-alex-jackson-sent-back-extended-spring-training-with-shoulder-pain/", "id": "t3_36r8rt", "author": "CGidari", "title": "Alex Jackson sent back extended spring training with shoulder pain", "timecreated": 1432217550.0, "subreddit": "Mariners", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rylc"}, {"score": 16, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/36rw2o/build_10122_nvidia_display_driver_issue/", "id": "t3_36rw2o", "author": "kellerdominator", "title": "Build 10122 : Nvidia display driver issue?", "timecreated": 1432227927.0, "subreddit": "Windows10", "selftext": "Got 10122 from windows update today\nthen everytime I run a program with my nvidia GPU (GT740m), program will crash, and \"display driver stopped responding and has recovered\" popup appear\n\nDoes anyone have this issue? \np/s : nvidia driver from WinUpdate too, 349.90", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u9xs"}, {"score": 916, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/36rwfa/lcs_survey_results_summer_2015_favourite_teams/", "id": "t3_36rwfa", "author": "ajsadler", "title": "LCS SURVEY RESULTS - Summer 2015.

I saw the Edo Ai denim on there and knew I had to have something made of denim with 50% sugar cane fiber. After throwing some ideas back and forth with /u/mfarmtown, we came up with some general specs and eventually purchased the fabric. She did a couple eras of a test shirt out of duck while we were both still in Chicago to get the fit how i liked it, and during this past summer she spent her free time between store orders [working on my shirt](http://imgur.com/nHCtVs7). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI received it exactly [a month ago](http://imgur.com/DoCsRTq) and have done my best to wear it and break it in before the Texas summer truly takes hold and tries to kill me. Anyways, time for the photos I took last night. I waited until now because I wanted to get a bit of molding in it before i posted. Let's take the tour...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's the SC 40500 fabric, a 14.25oz unsanforized selvedge denim from Sugar Cane made with 50% cotton fibers and 50% sugar cane fibers. It is [extremely textured](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17262858763/sizes/l) and rough to the touch with little sugar cane stalk? pieces that add a definite itch factor before they get abraded out of the fabric. There's a cool [variation in color](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17260819014/sizes/l) throughout the fabric and it has a green/emerald caste to it. /u/mfarmtown and I decided it would be best to just presoak the fabric before construction of the shirt since we weren't familiar with the way it would shrink once formed into [a shirt](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17884276545/sizes/l). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI decided to go with a [spread collar](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17884004225/sizes/l) design and she even managed to put some cool [collar stay slots](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17880746072/sizes/l) on the underside. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNext are the [pockets](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17857780926/sizes/l) which I designed myself, and she liked the design so much she decided to use it in her next run of shirts! I feel pretty proud of that one. On the left pocket is also a selvedge [sunglasses loop](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17263528993/sizes/l) courtesy of the mind of /u/chronicelectronic. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen /u/mfarmtown was at Denim Bruin many moons ago, she asked Roy Slaper to do one of his custom felt embroidered patches for me and I asked her to make it into an [inner pocket](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17880804122/sizes/l) on the shirt. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is [a lot of selvedge](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17695357990/sizes/l) on this shirt: sleeves, back, cuffs, side gussets, and button plackets. The selvedge sleeves contain one of my favorite details on the shirt, the point where [it all comes together](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17695346308/sizes/l). I'm not sure why, but this intersection always captures my attention whenever I look inside. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe [buttons](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17260992794/sizes/l) are made of coconut and she used [\"denim\" thread](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17857339946/sizes/l) throughout. The thread has a metallic indio color to it which I think will pop nicely once it fades.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI love the felled seams. They have a slight bulge in the center that reminds me of raised belt loops. They have a [different look](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17262974873/sizes/l) that I really like compared to the machine felled seams on my other shirts. And check out the cool [grosgrain tag](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17260705754/sizes/l)!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis thing looks amazing [inside out](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17879879762/sizes/l) and any time i take it off i find myself opening it up and looking around the inside just to see how things are molding and changing with wear. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis shirt is a really entertaining piece. It gets softer every day and I can't wait to get it to finally drape and fade down the line. Unfortunately this denim is all gone as far as we can tell so no more of these sugar cane beasts will be coming out in the future. Any questions y'all have please feel free to ask and I or /u/mfarmtown will do our best to answer. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading!", "subreddit_id": "t5_2scl9"}, {"score": 298, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/36qr29/tifu_by_being_a_responsible_student/", "id": "t3_36qr29", "author": "napoleonfucker69", "title": "TIFU by being a responsible student", "timecreated": 1432206952.0, "subreddit": "tifu", "selftext": "Some information on me: I am the daughter of an important teacher in my school so I don't like playing truant in fear of getting in trouble with my Mum, who's rather strict.

We were supposed to get out at 2 pm as my English teacher ditched us, but my classmates got the 'wonderful' idea of leaving at 1pm without telling anyone. So they decide that the EVERYONE must skip so we won't get in trouble if anyone remains behind (??? what sort of logic is that).\n\nI bluntly refuse. Last time I skipped my classes my Mum grounded me for a month and I don't want to repeat it as weekend is approaching and I want to hang out. My classmates get angry. One of them has the audacity to call me selfish and telling me to 'take it for the team' and leave with everyone else at 1 pm. I stand my ground. I can hear them insulting me.\n\nIt's 1 pm. Everyone leaves and I'm the only one that didn't leave. Teacher comes in, looks confused, ask me where everyone is and I tell her everyone left (at this point I'm very pissed off that my classmates wanted me to get grounded just for \"the team\") and the teacher storms off to the principal's and calls me as well. I am waiting outside the principal's office and I can hear yelling. A lot of it.\n\nI don't know what's going to happen to my classmates and frankly I don't care.

I'll be giving away between $50-$75 of games.  You can pick it in the post or I'll PM you if you win. \n\n**Duration**\nPosting will last for 48 hours from the start of this post.  I hate missing out on Giveaways just because I missed the time window on them.  I want more people to have a chance.\n\n**Why?**\nPedro says I'm not allowed to force anyone to meet a requirement before giving something away, so I'm hoping I can just get enough exposure to the PCMR to generate some interest.  For those of you who were born too late and missed out on the genre of MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons), there is an entire community (/r/MUD) of worlds built by regular people.  They provide some of the richest and greatest gaming experiences that you can get.  It's the same kind of experience a book can give that a movie can never provide.\n\n**Please check out**\n\nPlease check out this particular MUD at http://sh.ackmud.net/\nThere is no fee.  There are no ads.  There is no pay element at all.  Not for cosmetics, not to win, or anything.  Like a book, give it a shot beyond its first place and I can promise you a unique gaming experience akin to that of reading your favorite books.  We just want players.\n\n**MUD Client**\n\nI got a few PMs about a MUD client.  You can download a MUD client and connect directly to the MUD using sh.ackmud.net on port 7000.  You can use a client like GMUD32.  I got it from http://gutterstar.net/gmud.php\n\nThank you and Good Luck.\n\nObligatory Edit: This has gotten huge.  I've been offered up to about 30 more Steam Games that I will also raffle off to those who didn't get their game of choice.  If you have other games you want me to toss in the raffle, please let me know.  It should sweeten the odds for everyone else.\n\nEdit #2: Please check your posts to make sure you're actually within the 1-10k range.  There's also a few dozen people who somehow managed to turn their number into an ordered list, so they actually appear to have chosen the number 1.  Please double check your post.\n\nEdit #3 (5/22 5:40am EST): I have some personal obligations to take care of later today so I'm going to do the drawing a few hours early.  Very few submissions for numbers are trickling in.  Please be patient while I figure this out.\n\nEdit #4 (5/22 6:09am EST): Below are the winning numbers.  None of the winners selected a game, so I'll be sending them a PM.\n\n1016 - No Match (Sorry /u/Abui1016)\n\n8187 - No Match\n\n7099 - /u/Oldcustard - PM Sent.

TOTS is finally here.](http://i.imgur.com/7drHiqr.gif)\n\nWe mentioned a while ago that we had some things we were working on for the near future, and today, we can finally share some of that with you. So without further ado, the entire /r/FIFA mod team (ninjaciego, shane_solo, gourangaplusplus and I) are  happy to announce the *Official /r/FIFA TOTS Giveaway.*\n\n---\n\n**Here\u2019s how it will work:**\n\nEach week, one lucky member of the community will win a certain player from the current TOTS. Please note that the players will pre-determined in advance, you will not be able to choose the one you want. However, these players will be tradeable.\n\n**Are there any requirements for the giveaway?**\n\nYes. We\u2019re going to do this giveaway a little differently from what most of you may be used to, in the sense that we will have pre-requisites that your account must meet to be eligible to participate. This is because we want to reward true members of the community and decrease the possibility that alt or sleeper accounts have of winning. In order to enter into the giveaway, your account must be at least one month old and must have contributed to the subreddit during that time prior to the giveaway announcement. \n\n**How do I enter?**\n\nIf your account is at least a month old, post only one comment with your platform and Playstation ID or Xbox Gamertag or PC ID within. Multiple comments or comments that don\u2019t follow these rules can lead to disqualification. If you are caught trying to improve your chances by breaking the rules, you will be automatically disqualified from the remaining giveaways. \n\n**How are the winners picked?**\n\nWinners will be selected randomly by [reddit raffle](http://redditraffle.com) and will be contacted by the moderators each Tuesday, a day before each new TOTS is announced. This will be done by PM because we will need your gamer tag, platform, and Ultimate Team club name. Please note that once you\u2019ve won once, you cannot win again. \n\n---\n\nNote: If there is a weekend TOTS, there will be a giveaway for that as well! However, those entry threads will be up for less days so be alert so you don't miss your window to enter. Also, for every new TOTS, a separate entry thread will be made. Commenting in the first one does not enter you into every one!\n\n---\n\nGood luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor! And big shoutout for /u/ChuBoi7_EA for making this a reality!\n\n---\n\n(**This thread is just the announcement thread, the entry thread will be posted starting tomorrow. As a result, only post questions here and NOT your entries.**)\n-", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7"}, {"score": 13, "url": "http://imgur.com/WW2RGyQ.png", "id": "t3_36mt9k", "author": "zetzer", "title": "[GTM] Benjamin Franklin", "timecreated": 1432134875.0, "subreddit": "GuessTheMovie", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s570"}, {"score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Crossout/comments/36nr11/one_major_hurdle_for_creative_games_cookie_cutters/", "id": "t3_36nr11", "author": "kriegson", "title": "One major hurdle for creative games: Cookie cutters", "timecreated": 1432147837.0, "subreddit": "Crossout", "selftext": "If you give players a bunch of options to create something unique for themselves, what you more likely end up with is a handful of optimal builds that everyone flocks to.   \n\nHow do you think that problem can be circumvented?

But more often than that do I see Abathur players making inferior choices throughout the game on a hero that relies so heavily on choice making to be impactful. And guess what the go-to comeback is for every Abathur that\u2019s not willing to take advice from a teammate? Yup, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how Abathur works\u201d\n\nIt might just be my luck, but in all my Abathur games, I have seldom been called out for \u201cAFKing in base\u201d, and when I do, they do NOT mean that I was literally doing nothing, what a lot of them meant to say were \u201cYou could\u2019ve done things that might have had more impact on the map.\u201d But more often than not that gets translated into not knowing how the hero works, and posted on reddit so people with the same experience can pat each other on the back and complain about how toxic people are towards one particular hero out of the entire roster.\n\nContrary to common belief, I strongly believe that Abathur players can get away from making poor decisions and bad plays and passing unnoticed by the friendly team more than any other hero in the game. Again, yes, as Abathur I have played with that ungrateful Illidan who calls me useless not having a clue that I was the reason he was winning 2 v 1 fights that would\u2019ve just been a stupid dive otherwise. But more times than that I have made inferior choices on where to be present in the map or when to back out of a host so I can shield and save another teammate, but 9 out of 10 times it passed unnoticed by the team and most of the time I wouldn\u2019t notice it myself until I pull out the replays.\n\nHeck, I\u2019ve even went into 2 co-op games after reading yet another \u201cAba stop AFKing\u201d post, and literally AFKed. I got away with it because apparently \u201cThat\u2019s how Abathur works\u201d and I feel like people shy away from pitching in their advice for fear of being regarded as one of those \u201cbaddies\u201d they saw on reddit complaining about Abathur. It\u2019s like some kind of awareness movement that went too far to a point where people are afraid of pointing out the obvious.\n\nPoint of the post is not to bash the bad Abathur players or make up for the flame that they\u2019ve been missing out on, but to rather inform the Abbies out there that players are much MUCH more aware of how Abathur works than Abathur players give them credit for but not enough to actually know that they\u2019re playing bad, so cut them some slack already. Rather than making yet another \u201cMy teammates complained because I play Abathur\u201d post, try to take the biased lenses off and see behind the true reason they\u2019re complaining and ask yourself this:\nHave I been playing Abathur to his potential?\nPicking Abathur means one less body in teamfights, am I making enough impact on the map to justify putting my team at a number\u2019s disadvantage?\nAre there any unattended lanes that are safe to soak and push with my trait that I have been missing out on?\nCan the map/teamcomp afford to have one less body in the fight?\nThese are the questions that Abathur players should ask themselves, cause a lot of times no one will ever tell you that, I\u2019ve played with way more players that try to respect the way Abathur plays even though it is not optimal in the given situation than those who starts bashing at the beginning of the game.\n\nI really enjoy playing Abathur, its unique playstyle makes it so that you keep your morale high even in a losing game, since you are not in the front line and usually die less. And I can see it bringing out the fragile side of me, picking him as opposing to being in the front line well aware of some of the misplays that might have caused the team the game. At the same time, it puts me in less pressure to get good unless I impose it on myself. It doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s a community full of people that would pat you on the back and tell you you\u2019re doing just fine and people just don\u2019t understand, despite not even seeing how you performed in game.\n\nBefore the hotfix that removed the Lili, AnubDiablo bug, Abathur was also bugged, he got \u201cninja nerfed\u201d due to the cooldown issues with Symbiote and his deep tunnel being interrupted half way if he loses vision. Any good Abathur player know how much it would limit his potential and tend to shy away from playing him back in those few weeks. I happened to have the pleasure to play with one of the \u201cMisunderstood Abathur Mains\u201d from reddit channel during the time. I chat with him in queue and asked his opinion about the \u201cninja nerf\u201d in which he replied it doesn\u2019t really affect Abathur, and I thought, as an Abathur main, he must know what he\u2019s doing. Turns out that the deep tunnel bug never affected him, as in the 5 games we played together he never left the confines of the gates. Even in an extended mine fight when both teams were underground for an insane amount of time no lanes were soaked because Abathur never left base. Guess what he said when someone suggests that he \u201cstop AFKing\u201d in base and make use of that time to pressure lanes and do some soaking? Yup, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how Abathur works, I\u2019m not AFK OMG noob press tab, look I have hero damage and siege damage\u201d And I\u2019m sure another reddit post would be made on that issue if the teammate hadn\u2019t just said whatever forget it.\n\nTo sum up, I go back to the title, and it applies for people who want to get good at Abathur, obviously not applying to those of whom who regard any constructive advice as butthurt and not understanding the hero. \u201cNo, Abathur, you\u2019re not the special snowflake.\u201d Yes, you have a unique playstyle, yes, there are going to be times when teammates failed to be aware of the hat or your potential, but that does not mean that it never applies for other heroes. People run away while having divine shield on every day, you don\u2019t see 2 Uther posts every week, people failed to do enough damage when ETC pulled a good mosh pit every day, you don\u2019t see 2 ETC posts every other week. Ask yourself what you could\u2019ve done better, because with this \u201cAbathur awareness\u201d going on, no one else would.\n\nTl;Dr: Abathur awareness has gone a tad too far\n\nEdit:TLDR to avoid confusion\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13"}, {"score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/36s2oi/two_days_in_portland_what_cant_i_miss/", "id": "t3_36s2oi", "author": "12EggBreakfast", "title": "Two days in Portland, what can\u2019t I miss?", "timecreated": 1432230658.0, "subreddit": "Portland", "selftext": "[removed]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi2i"}, {"score": 327, "url": "http://imgur.com/a/XovfX", "id": "t3_36rg0a", "author": "ensiferum888", "title": "I lost my cat Whisky 2 days ago and I'm having a real hard time coping with it..

Maybe even forget. But now I've seen them again and I don't know what it means. I thought it would  be best to put my jumbled thoughts into writing and get it out there.\n\nThey'd said the economy was picking up but a year ago but it didn't seem that way to my friends and I so several of us decided to pool our resources and rent a loft. They call these things apartments but this place was more like a warehouse. Looking back, I wish we'd asked more questions. Like why they were asking so little for someplace so big. There were four of us: Jimmy, Walter, Robert and I. We'd only seen the place once, in the daytime and we loved it. There were rooms for all of us, a kitchen and it was dirt cheap. And huge.\n\nJimmy's girlfriend Laura came out with us when we started moving our things in. It was close to dark when we drove out there and the first thing I noticed  was that the whole area seemed practically deserted for several blocks around. The weather was turning stormy while we moved our boxes in and we decided to cook our first dinner in our new home. That was when we heard Laura scream and we all ran upstairs where we found her hysterically weeping in the corner. Gradually we got it out of her that she'd heard whispering in the walls so she'd gone searching for the source. Finding a crack in the wall, she'd held her phone up to it and snapped a picture with the flash on. By then she said, the whispering had ceased.\n\nI have to tell you, I thought she was making the whole thing up even after she showed us the picture. I didn't quite know how to take it. The image was a bit blurry and seemed to show what could have been several gray faces with round, large, black eyes. I'm ashamed to say, I laughed at her then and Jimmy almost hit me. I don't blame him now. But we shined a light into the crack and couldn't see anything but empty space so we decided to go eat. Our dinner was to have been a pot of chili but when we got back downtairs, the pot was on its side, some of its contents spilled on the floor, but most of it was missing. We were not alone.\n\nThere were no other signs of intrusion downstairs and all we had to go on was the upstairs loft so that wall had to come down. It took us about twenty minutes until we opened up a hole into a hallway that shouldn't have been there. Several rooms lay off of that hall, and it was there that I found them. I practically stumbled on them and I screamed much like Laura and ran out of the room. We went back in as a large group and they were just like children. Strange, when I first saw them they looked almost alien. Maybe it was just Laura's picture putting  weird thoughts in my head but looking at them now, they had shoulder length hair  and seemed to be all girls. Their skin was a bit ashen but otherwise normal looking. Most likely they hadn't seen the light of day in years.  Their eyes were black as coal but normal sized. There were about ten of them and they didn't speak a word.\n\nWe decided to call the authorities but the weather was now quite stormy and we couldn't get a signal. Walter said it was the walls and that we should go outside. I'll never know what made him decide to stay, but Jimmy said he would remain behind with the kids and look after them. Outside we managed to get through to the police but they treated the whole thing like a joke. They said that the loft was condemned and thought we were trespassing. Any further conversation was cut short by a blood curdling scream from inside. Running back in, we went upstairs and found a crowd of these creepy 'children' at the end of the hallway looking out the now broken window. I pushed my way past them and down on the street lay Jimmy's broken body. One of the girls, a blonde said he had fallen out the window. She refused to look at me. A chorus of voices confirmed her story, that he had fallen out of the window. I was trying to process their sudden verbosity when I noticed that their numbers had doubled. Their icy blue eyes were upon me and I felt my mind getting fuzzy and I was almost oblivious to Walter pulling me away from the window and down the hall. \"We have to get out of here\", he said, \"something's not right.\" I asked where Laura was; we hadn't seen her since coming back upstairs. Walter told me that Robert had gone looking for her.\n\nI had a bad sinking feeling then. My mind still felt strange, my thoughts hazy. I tried to protest when Walter said he was going to find Robert so we could get out of here. I'm not sure how long I waited, it could have been five minutes or forty minutes. I heard voices from the room next door and I crept down the now deserted hall towards the door. I should have headed downstairs but I had to know. Looking through the cracked open doorway I saw there must have been fifty of them packed into the room. They seemed to be arguing. One of them, the blonde from earlier apparently was uncomfortable with having lied to us. \n\nShe was telling the others, \u201cI agreed early on to always tell the truth.\u201d One of the others (a red haired one) replied, \u201cNo you didn\u2019t! You agreed the same thing we all did.\u201d \n\nI never did find out what that meant, exactly. At that point they all seemed to notice my presence and they came slowly out of every doorway in that hall. I'll never forget those icy blue eyes, almost glowing in the darkened hallway. I backed away from them and it felt like walking through tar. There was no sign of my friends as I backed down the stairs away from the children.\n\nDownstairs there were even more of them and it felt like my mind was shutting down. Somewhere close by, someone was screaming and screaming and I was only aware on a subconscious level that I was the one screaming.\n\nThe police found me in a nearby alley. I spent two weeks in observation in the local psych ward. Oh, they sent people to the loft but there was no bodies and no sign of habitation at all. I moved away from the city to get away but I've been unable to hold a job for very long and have been homeless for much of the past year. Lately I've been seeing them again. Blue eyes in the darkness. No matter where I go, no matter what city they always seem to find me. I think they've always been here among us.

Why did everyone treat it like nothing?", "timecreated": 1432964382.0, "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "selftext": "Hi TwoX, (throwaway obv)\n\nWhen I was about 3 or 4 - I had an aunty from overseas come over to visit. We were alone in a room and I remember she told me about how milk comes out of nipples and that if she sucked my nipples milk would come out. She also showed me her nipples and said that she would suck mine first and then I could suck hers. I was obviously young, stupid and ignorant (I knew nothing of sexuality or sexual/body boundaries). I let her suck my nipples. Luckily, my parents walked in. Everything stopped. After that I don't remember what was being said or discussed.  I remember my mother holding me and stranding around talking to my dad and other family members about it. \n\nI'm 28 now. Throughout most my life I have not really let it bother me. I have even hung out with this aunty many, many times. And she has not reoffended. I just don't get why my parents did nothing about it. Was it because it was just nipple sucking? I realise that is not serious to some people because it wasn't vagina/penis stuff. BUT what if my parents hadnt walked in on us? Would she have made me do other things? :( \n\nI've never really had a PROBLEM with this issue until now. I usually just block it out. It did give me some odd feelings when I first started getting intimate with boys and they played with my nipples. BUt I got over it quickly and stopped thinking about it. BUt suddenly yesterday - I suddenly realised I was sexually abused? RIght? is this sexual abuse?\n\nThat aunty has been living back in her home country for years now and has a young daughter. this scares me a little. IS she harming her daughter? I'm unsure if I should speak up. But it's weird because my parents and her family probabaly know what she's done, but they never took any action. \n\nBTW, this aunty is mentally ill - and everyone know that. Do they just let her slide because she's mentally ill? I have heard she takes medicine for her mental illness - maybe thats why noone did anything about it?\n\nMy family think I don't remember... I'm too embarrassed and ashamed to say I do. I assume people won't take this issue seriously because it wasn't full on rape and because shes a woman.\n\nI'm so sorry about this wall of text. \n\nANother thing - I have even heard another aunty of mine joke about it to my father in front of me - then I heard my father say don't bring that up. I acted ignorant like I heard nothing. ALso, once in the past when I was maybe 10 years old - the aunty who molested me joked about it in front of me to and I was like \"huh, what?\" acting ignorant and she quickly changed the topic.\n\nI'm unsure of what I'm looking for, not sure if i need a solution. Just need to vent I think. I'm doing alright. Just suddenly upset a bout it. Am I being selfish for not telling everyone and making a big deal out of it? Should I bring it up and somehow make sure she is not hurting her own child? I knwo she lives with ALOT of family and hope that the child is safe. I also don't want to tell my long-term partner because I don't want him to think about it when its nipple play time. \n\nI realise what ive been through is nowhere near as bad as most other sexual abuse victims.\n\nTLDR: Aunty sucked my nipples when i was 3 - almost made me suck hers but then parents walked in. No one thinks I remember and no one did anything about it ( i think). All my life i have ignored this issue. But suddenly I'm admitting to myself I was molested. But I feel stupid because it wasn't a \"full on\" rape. :\\\n\n(Thank you so much for replying if you do)\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt"}, {"score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/37w7wu/usaz_h_x2_bnib_i7_4790k_ipod_touch_5th_gen_w/", "id": "t3_37w7wu", "author": "motorcycle", "title": "[US-AZ] [H] x2 BNIB i7 4790k, iPod Touch 5th Gen [W] Verified PayPal", "timecreated": 1433025061.0, "subreddit": "hardwareswap", "selftext": "Hi guys, I got a pair of 4790k processors I was going to use for a two identical builds but the plans got scrapped.

I had been waiting for money to get oly shoes, and after reading a billion opinions, I decided on the romaleos. However, today is day 4 of squatting in them and they are killing the outsides of my feet (both insoles do this, I think the training one is worse), and yesterday started a nagging knee pain In both knees. It feels as if the outsides of my feet are sitting on something raised ad hard. I bought a half size lower than my frees, but the heel still feels loose, the top strap needs to be pulled so far that there is plenty to go under the shoe, but there is not much space in front of my toes (not sure if another half size down would be possible or comfortable).  I know squatting every day could cause knee pain, but I hadn't had it even slightly until these shoes (25th day squatting, 4th day in these shoes). Backsquats feel unbalanced, front squats feel ok (heavy weights in flat shoes would make me lean to my toes), and I tried overhead squats for the first time today with just the bar and they felt comfortable  (someone asked me how long I  had been doing them to get down the form so well, so that  at least boosted my confidence). I liked the feel in deadlifts and hit a new PR first time. I don't do crossfit. just straight lifting in these shoes. Anyone else have similar problems? I know they will take time to get used to, but it really feels like it's throwing my mechanics way off for the Backsquat especially (struggled getting 85% of 1rm for 1 rep). They dont feel very stable like everyone else claims unless I pull the straps painfully tight (making the strap length problem and foot pain problem worse).

Both in the films themselves and in the relationship between the original and the sequels there is much in common. I would go as far as to suspect that the films were an inspiration for Hotline Miami.\n\nREDEMPTION and HOTLINE MIAMI\nThe first instalments are both tightly contained and relentless in their action. Consisting mostly of clearing rooms and moving from level to level, dialogue is barely present, and characters are mostly developed through subtle cues without using words. The diversity of the combat is limited to a single type of setting, but all options within that setting are explored. There is little context at the beginning and the conclusion leaves a lot of unanswered questions, leaving some things entirely up to the audience. The production value is quite low but the expertise and focus of the production compensates for a lack of scale.\n\nBERANDAL and WRONG NUMBER\nThe sequels begin almost immediately where the originals concluded, showing the consequences of what was done. Action is broken up by longer portions of dialogue that reveal a deep lore that extends to before the original took place. The settings of the combat is wildly varied, including a prison riot and a subway. While a few central characters are present, most of the cast is new, bringing different techniques and perspectives that provide new information. The events span a course of several years and time switches forwards and backwards on several occasions. The conclusions indicate that nothing more is to come, and that the whole story has been presented. The production value was much higher than that of the original, but the quality of the action is not much better (not to say it is not outstanding).\n\nFor those familiar with the films, what do you think?

I was hoping for the car to hide in ... \n\n\nI did just that .. Sprinted up the rock .. I saw 3 people .. \n\nOne was off the bridge going around and under the other side .. Two others were on my side back tracking a little to get off the bridge ... \n\nSo i jump and make the jump .. \n\nThey put about 3 bullets into my body before i get in the truck and lock the doors .. \n\nSadly they had the spark plug ... \n\n\nSo i bandaged up and was ok ... \n\n\nThen one of them started calling me faggot ( i do not like that as being gay is normal and nothing is wrong with it )  \n\nThey tried to offer me a back pack to get out but with the guy spouting insuts at telling me to get out of the car as i was ruining their game play .... \n\n\nI sat in the car with them watching me for about 30 mins .. i did get up and eat REAL DINNER while listening to them bitch ... \n\n\n3 people came by one at a time they killed each on sight ..

I promised myself I would never get rid of it.\nWhen I was 20, I had moved out of state, and was living on my own, playing in bands, etc. I ran into money trouble. The only thing I could think was to sell or pawn my red Strat. But first, I called my grandfather to talk to him about it. I told him the situation, and he made me a deal. He would buy the guitar from me, but under one condition. That I would hold onto it until he decided he wanted it. \n\nThat bit of money got me back on track, and helped immensely. Any time I tried to pay him back for the guitar, he would tell me simply; \"It's not for sale\".\n\nA few years later, my Grandfather passed. I never got to pay him back for what he did for me, so I decided that I would make the guitar worthy of his name, since he does own it still.\n\nAs I got older, I realized red was just too flashy for my tastes, and wanted to refinish it black. So I started sanding. Had a friend with a body shop respray it matte black, and it turned out fantastic.\n\nChanged to a black pickguard, with some Texas Special pickups. Changed knobs to chrome knurled ones, installed a tusq nut + string tree, and wilkinson bridge. Had another buddy put in Fender F tuners. I'm glad that I enlisted good friends to help me with this piece. \n\nAnd the final piece, a custom engraved neck plate. Being handy with Photoshop, I had my mom send me something with his signature on it, scanned it, and mocked up the plate. Had a service on eBay custom engrave it.\n\nAfter all was said and done, I now have a guitar that means even more to me than it did before.

There's different picks I see in this ELO and I see what people are prioritizing over other picks. Honestly the reason I'm doing this post is to promote my channel and if you want to get this post earlier in video format, subscribe right **[here!](https://www.youtube.com/luigidragon)**\n\nJust going to do write a few pros and cons as it's a lot of work to write some stuff about champions so I want to shorten it and **in-depth explanations** are on the **videos** I created for this patch as long as **other champions (honorable mentions)** I talk about in multiple lanes, which is definitely one thing I would like to emphasize since I do value videos more than text posts.\n\nRemember, these champions are what I think are really good from my perspective in the games I've been in and I just look at how often/played and strength they have, everyone has there own opinions of whats good so I'm expecting a lot of conflicting comments AND I'LL BE WAITING FOR THOSE and there IS a difference in lower ELO and what is strong there (A MOO MOO, DA DONGER, MALZAHARHAR, etc.) but not really too god in higher ELO.\n_____________________________________________\n\n**TOP LANE**\n\n(1) **Irelia**: \n\n**Pros:** Incredible snowball potential, huge power spike with Trinity Force, 2 second stun, tanky (passive, R+W). \n\n**Cons:**True damage falls LATE game.\n\n(2) **Hecarim**: \n\n**Pros:** Homeguard ganks easy on bottom, very mobile around the map, can take ignite for kill pressure along with TP.\n\n**Cons:** Not a lot of tankiness besides W\n\n(3) **Vladimir**: \n\n**Pros:** With no ignite in the top lane and more tanks in the top lane, Vlad has a free lane to bully his opponents while they can't really do much to him. A lot of base damage, sustain, spell vamp, tanky with zhonyas and spirit visage, low CDs, scales extremely well into late game.\n\n**Cons:** No mobility, very little utility, easy to get picked off.\n\n(4) **Gnar**:\n\n**Pros:** Black Cleaver great item on him, CDR, HP, AD, and with all skills doing AD (except w) he makes an exceptional user with Black Cleaver and can do more damage in Mini Gnar form. Also, LOTS OF CC, good early-mid game\n\n**Cons:** Mega Gnar is the most useful form but lasts for a short amount of time and the CD on it is long because of a previous nerf. With that said, he falls off late game since Mini-Gnar is meh late game.\n\n(5) **Maokai**: \n\n**Pros:** Tanky, good utility when behind or ahead, probably one the best late game tanks, a lot of CC.\n\n**Cons:** Not the best laner.\n\n~~**Honorable Mentions:** ~~\n\n(HM) **Riven**: \n\n**Pros:** High Snowball potential, building offensively gives you defense (E), flash = dead carries. If very good riven player, this would be your #1 for top.\n\n**Cons:** Riven mains are eh on other champs and if people know your on the other team, they ban it. Also small nerf to her but I don't think it's that big.\n\n________\n\n**AD CARRY / MARKSMEN**\n\n(1) **Ashe**:\n\n**Pros:** A lot of Utility, great mid/late game scaling, can initiate from a far (also global), free clairvoyance on E, long range.\n\n**Cons:**: No escapes.\n\n(2) **Sivir**: \n\n**Pros:** Ultimate utility is GREAT, very high kiting, pushes waves easily, spell shield is OP as a defensive tool especially late game with 10 second CD.\n\n**Cons:** 500 range!\n\n(3) **Jinx**: \n\n**Pros:** Strong late game carry, long range, ultimate is great finisher.\n\n**Cons:** No escapes.\n\n(4) **Kalista**:\n\n**Pros:** Great at kiting tanks, Runaan's + BoTRK OP (both buffed this patch it's small but it helps), awesome mid game power spike.\n\n**Cons:**: Falls off late game\n\n(5) **Vayne:**\n\n**Pros:** Great dueling, Tank killer, great late game\n\n**Cons:** Weak laning phase\n\n____________\n\n**JUNGLERS**\n\n(1) **Nunu**:\n\n**Pros:** Cinderhulk + Q = easy clears (BIG EMPHASIS HERE, if he was decent without cinderhulk before in season 4 and just had single target clears, imagine having AoE clears on him to deal with the small camps), make ADC = SSJADC (Super Saiyan ADC) which makes him great late game, very strong peel with E and R. Great with skirmisher's to deal some true damage with autos. The nerf to Cinderhulk didn't hurt him because he's not up front hitting enemies he's trying to zone his enemies and position himself in team fights.\n\n**Cons:** Can't carry, has to rely on team to do carry him (easy for me cause everyone's got good mechanics in master/challenger)\n\n(2) **Gragas**:\n\n**Pros:** A tank jungler who's VERY good in the early game, TONS of CC, tanky with W + passive, a lot of base damage\n\n**Cons:** Skillshot reliant, can be outplayed (rush vs alex ich lololol)\n\n(3) **Nidalee**: \n\n**Pros:** Very strong jungler early game, good mid game, fast clears.\n\n**Cons:** Snowball reliant, Q skillshot reliant, no utility except heal.\n\nNOTES: Good Nidalee players (not me) are incredibly annoying and the risk of having a good one on the enemy team is too high and annoying to deal with, this is why she's banned and can be considered higher if your really good at her.\n\n(4) **Rek'sai**:\n\n**Pros:** Ult is great for farming, flanking unsuspecting enemies, great basic damage, awesome peel with W and stops gap closers if played right, TUNNELS FOR MOBILITY = FASTER CLEARS, map control, tanky with passive, good ganks. \n\n**Cons:** Only 1 CC, not a lot of utility when behind (but it's hard to get behind when you have fast clears)\n\n(5) **Sejuani**:\n\n**Pros:** Strong Jungler when ahead, has utility when behind/even, great base damage, liandry's OP synergy\n\n**Cons:** Slow start, Cinderhulk nerf hurt her because she's a more front-line tank.\n\n_________\n\n**MID LANERS**\n\n(1) **Ahri**: \n\n**Pros:** MS buff made her very hard to kill and also mobility is given, still has damage to kill people with full combo. Catch is still strong. Luden's echo user\n\n**Cons:** Skillshot reliant, gotta get close to use spells so a short/medium ranged mage\n\n(2) **Leblanc**: \n\n**Pros:** 1 of the champions who can still 1 shot people without DFG, all the challenjours got to challenjour with her + most played champion, map control, hard to kill, snowballs hard.\n\n**Cons:** AIN'T SO HOT WHEN BEHIND, falls late game\n\n(3) **Twisted Fate**: \n\n**Pros:** Decent poke, semi-global ultimate, Wave clear, Luden's echo user, 2 second stun every 6 seconds\n\n**Cons:** Easy kills in mid, no escapes (except ult but...)\n\n(4) **Cassiopeia**: \n\n**Pros:** Late game GOD, good counter initiate, a mage who does as much damage as an ADC\n\n**Cons:** High mana costs (mana management needed), medium range, no escapes\n\n(5) **Azir**:\n\n**Pros:** A lot of damage mid/late game, good poke / zoning with soldiers, wall to push back bruisers assassins, safe laning phase.\n\n**Cons:** Very high skill cap. Low base damage without AP (I guess useless when behind)\n\n_________________\n\n**SUPPORTS** \n\n(1) **Janna**: \n\n**Pros:** Ultimate heal + CC, godlike mobility with W Mobility Boots & Passive.\n\n**Cons:** Squishy, reliant on using skills efficiently\n\n(2) **Nautilus**: \n\n**Pros:** High CC, a lot of damage with E and a lot of utility, ult to lock-down enemies, scales great as he gets levels, TANKY.\n\n**Cons:** Can be poked down in laning phase. \n\n(3) **Thresh**:\n \n**Pros:** Good thresh players will carry, a lot of utility, basically does everything a support can do.\n\n**Cons:** Hard to master\n\n(4) **Leona**: \n\n**Pros:** High CC, naturally tanky with W.\n\n**Cons:** Can be poked down in laning phase.\n\n(5) **Bard**: \n\n**Pros:** A lot of utility, very good peeling, kiting and disengaging. Can split the enemy team in half with ultimate, good roams with passive + Q.\n\n**Cons:** NOOO damage, putting points into ultimate isn't very exciting (15 less seconds for cooldown WOW SO AMAZING), high skill cap using your ultimate properly.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n**VIDEOS**\n\nThe Video that this Tier List is based off of for more visual, these are the videos I made for this patch and also what I'm trying to promote off this text post!\n\n[PATCH 5.9 JUNGLE TIER LIST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb3CuqKk-bU)\n\n[PATCH 5.9 ADC TIER LIST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljhum64MnUkE)\n\n[PATCH 5.9 SUPPORT TIER LIST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_px-_Hc7FAU)\n____________________________________________\n\nThanks for watching/reading if you guys enjoyed it, if you want to support me feel free to subscribe to my YouTube channel right **[here](https://www.youtube.com/luigidragon)** and if this does good I'll try to do this for next patch too!

I have been following this sub for a while now and I running into an issue i'd like to share.\n\nI'm 30 and my wife is 27. Together for 4 years and married for 2. Pretty solid relationship, we are best friends and share alot of common interests. Trust has never been an issue in our relationship.\n\nSo my wife recently started her new job which generally requires long hours and they are a social bunch so drinks is usually on the cards most evenings.  \nNow that to me is not a problem as I like a happy hour every now and then and sometimes I work late too. \n\nHowever, i'm very respectful of her and our relationship and never really come past 10:30 or so as she starts to worry, and if she asks me to come back alittle earlier then I will. I simply felt that's what married people tend to do and I have seen others in a similar situation. \n\nHer respectful of me and my feelings? Not so sure. \n\nLast Thursday she came home at 3am blind drunk after a friends party.\nMonday: She came home at 2am but sober\nTuesday: Didn't come home \nWednesday: Didn't come home.\n\nSo as you can imagine last Thursday and Friday morning I was very frustrated but it doesn't happen often so i let it slide to an extent. Then when it happened again on Monday I was very upset and told her this isn't fair and that she is not respectful of me as I don't do it to her etc.. She appologised and we discussed and agreed that 11-12 is the latest we would stay out and she would text or call me to keep me posted. \n\nThe problem I have is that I struggle to sleep when she is out much later than 11 so if she is out till 2am, guess what.. i'm awake and I have work in the morning. \n\nSo Tuesday gets interesting. She goes out with old co-workers (all female) as she had sent me pictures of them eating and we had been in communication.. But after around 11 i get the 'coming home soon' text and then I don't really hear from her. I leave it a while then I call and text her but nothing.. I gave up after a while as it was really late and I had no idea where she was and just pressumed she would make it back at somepoint. She didn't.\n\nI get a text from her in the morning saying she crashed at her friends house as she went back there to have a few drinks and fell asleep. Hmmmm ok, this hasn't happened before so naturally i'm extremely frustrated and angry that this happened and I had no idea where she was or what she was doing.. We talk again that night which was obviously alittle more heated and she was saying stuff like 'what's the big deal, i stayed at a friends place' etc.. I expressed that this is single behavior and not telling me where you are or what you are doing is unfair on me. \nIn the end she didn't want to talk about it and brushed it off. \n\nWednesday night we had plans to go for dinner with friends but she is stuck at work and can't make the dinner. We have dinner and I head back thinking she will return so we can talk more about what is going on. \nI fall asleep briefly and i get a text at 12 saying that she is going for drinks with co-workers and invites me to go.. Too late. I text her back saying I can't believe this is happening again after I have expressed my issues the day before. She texts back saying that I'm mad so she is going to stay with them.. And she doesn't return. AGAIN. And I barely sleep. AGAIN.\n\nSo the questions now start rolling.. Is she cheating? met someone else?, would rather hang eith co-workers than her husband?.. Very difficult to kick those thoughts. \n\nWe haven't really spoken since and I have no idea what to do now. It's all happened so quickly and we have a trip planned soon which I'm most likely going to cancel due to this behavior.\n\nPart of me wants to just get out for a few days and not say anything but i feel that would be stooping to her level. Very frustrating and upsetting. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? If so, how did you deal with the issue? Again, any advice would be extremely helpful. \n\n\n\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2reak"}, {"score": 95, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/5TJksSb.jpg?1", "id": "t3_36w6an", "author": "dlegatt", "title": "[photos]Slow day at work", "timecreated": 1432313789.0, "subreddit": "MechanicalKeyboards", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ugo7"}, {"score": 6, "url": "https://youtu.be/Dbu6KbP68ck", "id": "t3_36wpiz", "author": "DeathGrips619", "title": "CMDR DeathGrips vs. CMDR Pheyes (Round 1)", "timecreated": 1432322091.0, "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60"}, {"score": 4, "url": "http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=8b8_1432154207", "id": "t3_36tqs5", "author": "jailhousebrew", "title": "Man Gives Cop the Finger - Cop Pepper Sprays Him.", "timecreated": 1432257918.0, "subreddit": "firstworldanarchists", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw5r"}, {"score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/36wqcb/why_are_almost_all_browser_jokes_made_of_internet/", "id": "t3_36wqcb", "author": "MysteriousWolf", "title": "Why are almost all browser jokes made of internet explorer?", "timecreated": 1432322449.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"score": 408, "url": "http://imgur.com/a/iwh2f", "id": "t3_36vufp", "author": "wahle509", "title": "Fear the Walking Dead On-Set Photos (Imgur Album)", "timecreated": 1432307101.0, "subreddit": "thewalkingdead", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rygv"}, {"score": 5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/36vtnf/serious_question_and_nsfwhow_many_girls_want_to/", "id": "t3_36vtnf", "author": "hi_im_leigh", "title": "Serious question and NSFW--How many girls want to use their girl penis?", "timecreated": 1432306768.0, "subreddit": "asktransgender", "selftext": "Ok so my partner and I at least for now aren't sexual at all.

Today I checked in again and I weighed 218.5 lbs. \nI know there's a lot of little factors that go into it, but is this even possible to lose ~15 lbs in a month?", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w"}, {"score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/36wqa2/whats_something_only_babies_know/", "id": "t3_36wqa2", "author": "Spitalian", "title": "What's something only babies know?", "timecreated": 1432322425.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"score": 17, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/36w9t5/hit_and_run_on_grant_street_between_ellsworth_and/", "id": "t3_36w9t5", "author": "theallusionist", "title": "Hit and run on Grant street between Ellsworth and 1st Friday morning -- can you help find the other driver?", "timecreated": 1432315257.0, "subreddit": "Denver", "selftext": "I heard a large crash this morning around 7:15 a.m., and came outside to find that my blue Honda CR-V had been badly hit by another driver who had immediately sped off.

Based on the height of the damage and the paint transfer, I'd guess a white truck or SUV.

I have filed a police report and spoken with my insurance company, of course, but I was hoping that I could perhaps find a miracle through this community. Many of my neighbors heard the crash (it was really loud!), but so far no one has seen anything.\n\nIf you or anyone you know lives near here and may have seen anything, or know anyone with cameras within a few block radius that are pointed at the street, please please let me know!

The article text mentions the idea of putting medical systems in the back (Cutlass Red), and a variant that is more combat focused (Cutlass Blue - I bet there is enough room in the back of a Reliant for a prisoner). \n\nI am wondering if they intended to build a 'tier 2' starter ship but ended up building a Half Cost Cutlass instead. If so MISC looks like it did a fine hatchet job on Drake.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v94d"}, {"score": 10, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/36wqyq/if_corporations_were_actually_people_which_of/", "id": "t3_36wqyq", "author": "Lobsterbib", "title": "If corporations were actually people, which of them would deserve to be in jail by now?", "timecreated": 1432322727.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"score": 10, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/36wovg/tomt_help_find_a_foreign_film/", "id": "t3_36wovg", "author": "zenona", "title": "[TOMT] Help find a foreign film", "timecreated": 1432321808.0, "subreddit": "tipofmytongue", "selftext": "We thought it was Ingmar Bergman, but can't find it under his name.

Unfortunately, I started after many people had swept up and thrown away most of their leaves from the winter.

It took a couple trips, but I eventually filled the compost bin with leaves (dry and not packed down). \n\nI've been adding mostly coffee grounds (and the occasional vegetable/fruit scraps) to the composter for a couple weeks now. Since I continually produce this, but am no longer gathering up leaves, I'm concerned that my resulting compost will be very heavy on nitrogen and light on carbon. \n\nShould this be a big concern? I've read that sometimes people add spent coffee directly to the soil, so that makes it seem that a nitrogen-rich compost (20:1 rather than 30:1) shouldn't be *too* bad.

Johnson\n\n2. Killorn\n\n3. Kucherov\n\nPros:\n\n- For the better part of periods 1 and 2, we had the better half of the chances.\n\n- Shots were 37-26, shot attempts were 63-41.\n\n- Power play was actually effective. 2/5.\n\n- The second line continues to generate offense. Kreider and Stepan with goals, 5 shots for Step.\n\n- We had the edge in faceoffs 31-26. (Bizarro world tonight). Everyone who took a draw except Fast with 50% or higher.\n\n- Thought Miller had a pretty good game, showed some energy and got a few chances.\n\n- Hayes was decent.\n\n- Boyle with 2 assists and 5 shots. \n\nCons:\n\n- Taking way too many penalties against a team that can punish us with them. 6 power plays for the Bolts, they converted on three.\n\n- Defense was pretty atrocious. Lots of sloppy giveaways and unforced errors and breakdowns.\n\n- Penalty kill was not effective. 50%.\n\n- Surprised to put this here, but Hank. There's not really a way to give up 6 goals on 26 shots and it be acceptable. Way out of position on the fourth goal. Couple of sloppy plays with the puck.\n\n- MSL with basically the worst sequence possible. Went from opening the game with a 5 on 3 to being down early. Showing either age or frustration.\n\n- Not crazy about Staal's game tonight to be honest. Went down 3-1 because he lost his balance in open ice.\n\n- Need to convert on our chances. Big difference here wasn't really in the play but that the Bolts converted and we didn't.\n\n- Didn't take advantage of Bishop's various mistakes.\n\n- Need to shut down the god damn triplets.\n\n- 14 giveaways\n\n- Had a chance to come back in the third period and looked completely dead.\n\n[Boxscore](http://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/boxscore?id=2014030312)", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rnpb"}, {"score": 226, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/36feiw/live_raw_discussion_51815/", "id": "t3_36feiw", "author": "Sensiitivity", "title": "Live Raw Discussion: 5/18/15", "timecreated": 1431991814.0, "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "selftext": "[](/cole) Welcome, everyone, to Monday Night Raw!

This happened today before work. My girlfriend of 2 years left me. She is 19 also and lives 25 miles from me. So we only see each other maybe twice a week. It was hard, but we loved each other. She was kind to me, but had a hardened heart towards my friends. This was due to the fact my friend had dated and crushed her sister. She hated the other friend because of church problems and drama.\n\n It was really straining on our relationship. We tried so hard to make it work. So it did for almost 2 years, but recently she started telling me i had to lose my friends to keep her... i started cancelling on my friends, but it hurt so much to tell them no for her. It broke my mind and spirit more than a few times. \nSo on a day previous to today, i told her that enough is enough, and my friends were staying. Eventually she got over it, yet apparently it wasn't enough... \n\nSo yesterday i went to hang with my two best friends (those mentioned before) and she lost it. It was devastating. She told me she couldn't talk to me until the next day. So i wake up to her breaking up with me. \n\nThis is the deepest pain i have ever felt. This cuts too deep. I couldn't reach it with a knife. This pain is like a hot blade piercing my mind and heart... but the saddest thing is that i'm almost glad to be heart broken.. its the first real emotion i've felt in so long. It feels so good feel... \n\nbut still it hurts to the point that I can't breath. I work at a daycare and i was surprised how good i've gotten at hiding my emotions. The kids didn't notice anything. I feel like its all my fault, and all the love i had for her will be thrown away and those two years will be for nothing but a learning experience. \nI know that this is the internet, and posting something religious is asking for a fight, so please refrain from the dueling of religion. My spirituality fell, i feel so far from God, that when i cried out in pain, i felt alone. I felt the pain of separation.. so my love is dead and i'm here on my bed listening to cage the elephant, wondering what my life will be now... At least i've got my friends. What should i do? I love reddit btw\n\n\ntldr: My girlfriend hated my friends and broke up with me because I wouldnt stop being friends with them.

I'm also a student. I like the colour blue and rabbits for their long ears. I am a quiet person and i tend to be socially awkward and constipated. I live in a student housing building where i have my own tiny room. I share the kitchen and the bathroom with another girl i'm mostly friends with. This girl, lets abbreviate her as A, sometimes takes me to parties and other activities with her friends. She often tells me only hours before which can cause colissions with my schedule. \n\nI was very constipated and I had not pooped for four days. In order to to solve this situation, i bought a pack of D....lax, which, according to the instructions, should start working 6 hours after beeing taken. My belly was bloated and as i considered the problem to be severe, I took three pills at about 4 pm. When i came home at 7 pm, my roommate offered to take me with her in an hour. 1 had never taken a laxative before, i used to take only dried plums, prune juice, psyllium husk, soda or sugar-free food wich would usually restore the normal order within a day. I thought that the contents of my bowels would just move down faster and remain at their solid consistency. I expected to feel the urge to go after 6 hours and i thought that i would either be able to stay after a visit to the bathroom or that i could easily make it home. When i went to the bathroom before we departed, i did not feel the urge to poop despite trying. I had no reason the expect the events that were to come. \n\nThe party took place in a neighbouring block of flats. About thirty people attended and it was fairly crowded. I generally enjoyed it, but remained in a quiet corner and did not drink. My misery begann at about 9 pm. At first it was just a little cramp and i just thought that my period was about to start early. Five minutes later it was as if something was moving inside my belly. It could feel the right side becoming lighter while something was flowing to the left side. I still did not feel any pressure. There was just this tense feeling and my lower bottom started to get somewhat warm. It remotely felt as if i was getting horny, but i had just been looking at a bottle on a desk for the last minutes. Then suddenly, a diffuse feeling of something pushing against my rectum became urgent. I stood up and made my way towards the bathroom, but this just increased the pressure. Upon reaching the bathroom, i soon found it to be not useable: On completely drunk guy was sitting on the toilet with his pants down and someone was laying on the floor and in the shower. I was not drunk, I had decency, so abusing the sink was out of question. As is rushed out of the bathroom, i came to the realisation, that I only had few minutes to find a place to relieve myself. I rushed out of the flat and began to search for something. There were no secluded corners or cabinets. Then i noticed that that block had the same layout as our block and that our block had escape stairs from the floors. After a short run, i reached the door to the stairs, that is hidden behind a corner. It was just a short run away, but i was not sure that i was going to get there in time. When i tried to open the door, it wouldn't. After a few seconds of shock, i realised, that i was pushing instead of pulling. Once i got out, i contemplated my action. The platform has a floor that is esentially a metall grate. The stairs down were blocked by a door that only opens downwards. If i went down there, i would not get back up again. I also would have not be able to get back inside, as the door to into the building could only be opened from the inside. I could have gone onto the stairs upwards, but i was afraid that someone could see me there.\n\nMy butt was hurting badly. The pain was similar to a muscle, that is strained after lifting something heavy. The pain was stronger than my desire to find the least problematic place. I lowered my pants and went into a squatting position. It was a quiet, slightly rainy night. I could faintly hear the music from the flat i had just run out of. From my position on the sixth floor, i could overlook the area. Noone was there.  I just stopped holding it in and the thought of the relief that was to come was only disturbed by the smell of cigarette smoke. It was as if my butt was forced open by a garden hose that was hidden inside it. There was a continuous and heavy flow for at least ten seconds. There were a few tiny solid pieces that caused pain as they hit my butthole while exiting. I was shaking so much that when i began to pee it would not even flow continuously. Although i was not completely empty, and a burning feeling arose in that region, I felt light again and my bloated belly was turning into its graceful, skinny figure again. Suddenly, there was a voice: \u201eDid the gutter tear or something?\u201c. A second voice, apparently a girl, added \u201eMy neck is wet\u201c. I realized that i was caught. I put my hands on my stomache to increase the pressure to finish as soon as possible when a voice down there said \u201eSomeone is up there\u201c. A flashlight flashed up from below, i was scared and then the second wave came out of me. Below me, a scream rose through the night: \u201eShit, thats shit\u201c. \u201eHe's shitting on us\u201c - \u201eNo dude, do you see that? That's a girl\u201c.  I  quickly wiped with a tissue that i already had at my hands. The flashlight from the platform on the floor below me was still lighting up. They could see enough to make a rude comment about my labia. I put another tissue over my butthole like a pad, put on my pants again and rushed back inside.\n\nThe flat was only a few doors away. I had left the door open, so i  left myself back inside. I had only been gone for a few minutes and as i knew only few people, noone seemed to have noticed that i was gone. I was planning on leaving, as i was not feeling well. I went to pick up my cardigan that i had left at the place i had been sitting at. When i was about to get out. Someone was yelling outside and knocking at the door. I rushed back as far as possible.  Someone had opened the door. The person that opened the door started screaming against the people yelling from outside. Alarmed from the screams, the people from inside the flat rushed to the door. The situation turned into chaos. Standing outside were the people i had just pooped on. As everyone who is screaming gibberish while beeing covered in poop, they presumed to be crazed and their attempts to come in were fended off with a broom. Within seconds, the whole floor showed up. The situation did not calm down, the people outside were looking for the person that did this. I did not see them, but i heard people saying that the were covered in feces. I went onto the balcony, when someone from the neighboruing flat went into their balcony and started yelling down for help. This attracted further audience from outside. The people outside could be convinced to return to their flat. I used the first opportunity to escape. Many people were rushing up the stairs to see the outraging situation and despite looking very normal, i expected any of them to identify me as the culprit.\n\nWhen i returned to my flat, i cleaned myself up and pooped some more. My roommate returned two hours later, she showed me some photos she had made of the poor people below me. I had completely hit them \u2013 two guys and one girl. I went to bed shortly afterwards. Rumors about the event spreaded quickly on Facebook. My unintentional victims apparently gave a description to the building management, that caused amusement \u2013 they were looking for a girl with a blue skirt, when interested people asked for a more precise description, the word \u201eshaved\u201c was used in official notices. Luckily, their description was not correct, they mistook my blue shirt for a skirt.\n\nTL;DR : I took a laxative, underestimated the effects and my poop got over other people.\n\n**Minor Update & Further Details:** It seems that i have avoided all suspicion so far. When time has passed, i will probably tell my roommate who is by the way functioning as my best friend. As far as i could find out, my poor victims were slightly drunk and can not remember every detail. I know their names and their door numbers and in the next days, i will send them gift cards for the communal launderette. Pictures of them were deleted off Facebook and other Social Media. One of their friends has commented on Facebook that they wish their identities to be kept secret. This has not stopped people from spreading the news. I heard people talking about the incident when i went to my classes, but as it is with rumors, the details are changing and sometimes obscure additions are made. I don't know if it is true, but it was said that my poor victims made it into a flat and - as noone wanted to get near them - managed to corner the people inside there before they could convince them that they had nothing to do with their misery. It also appears to be, that there were multiple parties on that floor, so the speculations are not even sure where the culprit came from. \n\nI'd like to thank the kind stranger who gifted me gold and everyone who gave me suggestions for my health. I strongly suspect that the cause for my constipation was my period, which started early today. I still have classes for today and as cramps won't be the only nuisance, there is a small probability which will hopefully not realize itself, that similar events are going to occur.

On May 18th of last year, I [announced](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/25vxw1/id_like_to_show_you_what_ive_been_working_on_for/) the alpha version of QKSMS. The response was amazing, and the community grew to about 20k users before the full launch of the app, and since then there\u2019s been well over 100000 downloads. They app impressed some people enough to give me a real job as an Android dev, and everything since then has gone incredibly well. I\u2019m not sure me or the app would be where we are today without the help of reddit, which is pretty crazy when I think about it\n\nTo thank you all, we\u2019re giving away 5000 copies of QKSMS+ for free. It\u2019s easy! Here\u2019s how you do it:\n\n1. Download QKSMS ([Link here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moez.QKSMS)), make sure you\u2019re on version 1.7\n2. Visit [qklabs.com/qksms-promo](http://qklabs.com/qksms-promo/), and copy one of the codes that show up\n3. Go to Settings -> View all settings -> QKSMS+ -> Redeem code\n4. Enter your code, and submit it. The codes are case-sensitive, so keep that in mind\n5. You now have QKSMS+!\n\nWhen you're activating your code, you'll need to be quick! Everyone sees the exact same 5 codes on the site, and when one is used, you can see it get deactivated removed from the list while a new one pops in :) It's actually really fun to watch and see codes being activated in real-time, I'm glad it's working so well!\n\nThe app has come an incredibly long way since the last time I posted about it here, here's just a couple of the important changes\n\n * Much better MMS support\n * More material design + animations\n * Better MMS UI\n * In-app MMS feedback reporting (if the app can't find your APNs, use this and we get back to you directly with the settings you should use, while putting them in the app for the next update)\n * Better settings UX\n * Automatic emoji replacement (like facebook messenger)\n * Stability/performance improvements\n * Full Android Wear support\n * \\*not important but pretty damn cool - You can change the app icon on your homescreen to match your theme\n\nAs a little PSA, we have a new [tester community](https://plus.google.com/communities/104505769539048913485)! This one doesn't require permission to join, and the posts are public so anyone can jump in and give feedback. You can sign up for the beta builds on this page\n\nUsually when I post on here there's a massive wall of text, I won't make you guys go through that again haha. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to AMA! In the spirit of the rest of my posts, I'll get back to everyone\n\nEdit: We're getting the ol' reddit hug of death on our Firebase server, I'm upgrading the plan now. Will keep you guys updated\n\nEdit 2: I've upgraded the plan. The site should be working fine now\n\nEdit 3: Holy crap you guys.. we didn't expect such a huge response. Looking at the promo code site, they're disappearing so fast it's insane. We're gonna modify the site right now to show 8 codes rather than 5 at a time so they're a bit easier to grab\n\nEdit 4: Its getting even harder to activate, so we now show 12 codes at a time. I haven't been responding for the last 30 mins or so - I'll be back soon\n\nEdit 5: We had no idea so many of you guys wanted this. The codes are all gone already. We don't want the fun to be over yet though... We're adding another 5000 codes! Give us a few minutes to get them ready\n\nEdit 6: The final edit (probably). The last code was just used, so we're now all out. This whole thing was absolutely incredible, I didn't expect such a big response from the community, but I'm happy that everything went as smoothly as it did. Thank you all so much for the incredible support you've shown. If there's anyone who asked a question and I missed them, feel free to ping me again. I got home about 2 hours ago and have responded to 1-200 messages since then, and it's 4am now, so as you can imagine, some may have slipped through the cracks haha. Going to get some sleep now, will get back to any new comments in the morning.

Kreider and Stepan with goals, 5 shots for Step.\n\n- We had the edge in faceoffs 31-26. (Bizarro world tonight).

Lots of sloppy giveaways and unforced errors and breakdowns.\n\n- Penalty kill was not effective. 50%.\n\n- Surprised to put this here, but Hank. There's not really a way to give up 6 goals on 26 shots and it be acceptable. Way out of position on the fourth goal. Couple of sloppy plays with the puck.\n\n- MSL with basically the worst sequence possible. Went from opening the game with a 5 on 3 to being down early. Showing either age or frustration.\n\n- Not crazy about Staal's game tonight to be honest. Went down 3-1 because he lost his balance in open ice.\n\n- Need to convert on our chances.

I have a lot of issues in my life I've been working on (making some slow and steady progress), but I am still lost and clueless with most things on the social side. As for friends, I only really have a small handful of online friends who live hundreds or thousands of miles away, and I rarely have the chance to talk to anyone aside from a couple people I sometimes work with, so I don't have really anyone in my life to do anything with. Aside from that, I don't get out much, again due to not having anyone to do anything with, or knowing how to get involved in something.\n\nMy question is more or less, what exactly should I try to do? My town isn't exactly an active place and is somewhat small / limited, but I really have no idea what I should even try to do alone that I still might be able to enjoy by myself?

If otherwise, I will specify.\n\nI don't believe sex between an adult and a person under 16 to be inherently harmful to the underaged person. I believe that once a male or female reaches puberty that it's completely natural to be attracted to them, regardless of age. We've been programmed through our evolution to be attracted to those showing signs of sexual maturity, and society paints that as wrong. I don't believe child sex to be inherently harmful, but I do believe that there are a multitude of reasons it can go wrong. I also believe that there's a huge difference between a mutually beneficial relationship, and a situation in which the older partner is just using the child for gratification. There's a high correlation with the latter situation and children who are emotionally scarred from sexual experiences they may have had.\n\nOnce you've hit puberty you become attracted to the opposite sex (or the same sex), and your natural instincts kick in. You probably masturbate a ton while you look for a partner willing to have sex with you. It's with this notion that I believe that children have the ability to consent. They are aware of what sex is, and are actively seeking it. It's our entire reason for existence, and to ignore those factors is asinine. Even the law acknowledges that children have some form of consent. Statutory rape is punished much lighter than rape of a minor is. Neither involve physical violence, but one is with the child's consent, while the other is not.\n\nAs it stands though, I don't think anything should be changed from its current state until sexual education in the US is widely taught at an early age. The current system doesn't allow for many non harmful relationships.\n\nSorry if this seems super disjointed. I'm on mobile, and I'm trying to compact an essay's worth of topics into a tiny reddit post. It's almost my bedtime, too, and this tiny screen is making it hard to build a well coherent post.\n\nI consider myself to be a hebephile, but my attraction is not exclusive. I currently have a girlfriend my own age, but I still understand my attractions. So, feel free to ask me anything on the topics.\n\nIf you need better explanation on any part of this post, just ask. I'm always down for a healthy debate, and I try to think critically so I encourage whatever discussion you want to bring to the table.\n\nEdit: Gonna go to bed.

Take the phillipines, or Malaysia, I have to research more higher tech'd railroads to even place them down in those zones because of forests. Two questions, is there a way to negate, and effectively bypass the negatives that you get from not being able to instantly build the railroads there? Or am I stuck with always weaker railroading systems? And two, if that's not possible, that does indeed mean that some nations are always going to be better for industry because they can build better railroads?\n\n2. Colnoy possessions, I read in a thread earlier that it's better to just get them from Africa, and get people in a sphere as time goes on, but generally are there colony's in Asia and Africa that people generally always usually go for that are pretty great? I usually just end up getting Loango, Madagascar, and Johore then I'm just kind of all over the place not really knowing where to go next.\n\n3. Artillery. How come sometimes I can go ahead and build more infantry, but Artillery is greyed out? This happens with other units as well. Where as I can always build Infantry (If I have the pop to support) I sometimes can't build Artillery or even Hussars. Why is that?\n\n4. Late game I always end up seeing a good alliance of Netherlands, Portugal, Britain etc. And Britain ends up with a LOT of nations Sphered.

This is also a concern for new players who need to learn the unique mechanics in WF and dying all the time would frustrate them. Many people believe that the best way to fix this would be to simply \"get better mods\" and for many, it is not that easy. An easy way to fix this would be to implement the \"Second Wind\" Mechanic*. \n\nIntroducing this into WF's solo play would allow for more versatility in the various game modes. This couldn't be abused as many people think b/c seeing that whenever you go down multiple times in a row, you Bleed Out health reduces quicker every time(and you get back up with a portion of health). This will eventually lead to Bleed Out draining quicker and the player eventually using their revive.\n\n(If implemented to multiplayer(no pvp), this would allow for more survivability for the entire team instead of running to a down team mate which in some cases is leaving objective point.)", "subreddit_id": "t5_2urg0"}, {"score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/perktv/comments/378m3a/do_i_need_to_turn_on_my_tv_in_order_to_use_perk/", "id": "t3_378m3a", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "Do I need to turn on my tv in order to use perk live ?", "timecreated": 1432582797.0, "subreddit": "perktv", "selftext": "[deleted]", "subreddit_id": "t5_30vzi"}, {"score": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/378qpg/every_neighborhood_has_its_resident_crazy_person/", "id": "t3_378qpg", "author": "ItwasaDinosaur", "title": "Every neighborhood has its resident crazy person.

Since that moment, I've bought every Total War game. But I feel like Total War is going downhill. I'll focus on the comparison between Rome/Medieval and RomeII/Attila. \n\n#Building problems\n\n**Rome Total War**\n\nYou want to travel faster? Build/upgrade roads. \n\nYou want more protection? Build/upgrade walls. \n\nYou need more public order? Build/upgrade a temple. \n\nYou need soldiers? Build/upgrade barracks. \n\n**Rome II/Attila**\n\nRoads and walls have been removed as separate buildings. \n\nYou can't just build something, you need a population surplus to start a new construction site. \n\nYou need to research things before you can build them. Only the most basic buildings are available from the beginning. \n\nNearly every building has big drawbacks. Most of them have a public order penalty, squalor penalty and/or cost food. So you need to construct something that boosts public order after you've built a 'useful' building. And then you need to build something that produces food for those buildings. But because you lack a population surplus, you can't build anything anymore...\n\n#Too many factions\n\n**Rome/Medieval**\n\nOnly the big factions are represented. At the start of a new campaign, you can conquer 'rebel cities' to expand in the direction of your choosing. Diplomacy is meaningful, big factions means big choices, and turn loading times are quicker (less factions=less computing). \n\n**Rome II/Attila**\n\nInstead of a dozen big factions, there are fifty tiny factions. Every tribe is treated as an independent faction. Instead of declaring war on the Gauls or the Germans, you're grinding through Alemans, Burgundians, and other tiny tribes. You need to manage diplomatic relations with way too many factions. \n\nThis causes turn loading times to increase as well. I've already explained that building is slower in the newer games, but if turns take longer progress is a lot slower too. \n\n#DLC has too little content for too much money\n\n**Rome/Medieval**\n\nExpansions were separate from the main campaign and offered a new map/time period/factions. It took quite a while after the release of the main game before expansions were released. \n\n**Rome II/Attila**\n\nRome II has 4 DLC's, \u20ac7.50 each, that only make a couple of minor factions playable in the campaign. You need to pay \u20ac7.50 to be able to play as the Greek states, and another \u20ac7.50 to play as the 'Black Sea colonies', that are very similar to the Greek states. \n\nThen there are two DLC's that only add a couple of units (\u20ac2.99/\u20ac2.50). There are also three \u20ac14.99 DLC's that add new maps, but they're just parts of the old map with some new (copy-paste) towns. There are barely any new things that are substantially different from the main game. You also have to pay \u20ac2.50 to add Blood&Gore. \n\nRome II is now a \u20ac55 game with \u20ac83 of DLC. \n\nAttila has only been released for a couple of months, but they've already released \u20ac25 of DLC with barely any substance. Three faction packs for \u20ac7.50 each, that only contain minor factions that are very similar to other factions, and of course a \u20ac2.50 blood and gore DLC. \n\n#Conclusion\n\nThe newer games contain some wonderful improvements. Not everything is totally negative. But I believe they also made a lot of choices that made the current games weaker compared to the older games. I would love to play a game that combines the best of both the current and the older games. And Creative Assembly's DLC strategy is terrible.

Feel free to add your own, may become more than an info dump then.\n\nOriginally started here:  http://forums.obsidian.net/topic/79252-info-synergy-of-abilities-v1/\n\nBut hoping to get reddit input for more things =)\n \n**--General Info (includes race, items, or game effects).--**\n \n[One defensive modal + multiple offensive modals]  Savage Attack is apparently considered a defensive modal. It will deactivate and be deactivated by Cautious Attack, Defender and Guardian.  You can only have one defensive and multiple offensive ones on.\n \n[Highest bonus:  Weapon/shield + Worn items (helms, armor, gloves, rings, boots) /  Chants +  Spells (includes Paladin Auras) + Talents + Per encounter + Racials]  PoE pulls from the various effects for your character to have the highest bonus in each.  For example, I could use a +2 might weapon, and wear a +1 might glove, and have +3 total.\n \n[Wood Elf + Any ranged attack or spell]  Unlike Marksman, this works on any ranged attack/spell.\n \n[Island Aumua (optional) + Quick Switch + Slow weapons]  With weapon swapping, the slower weapons like guns bypass much of their recovery issues.\n \n[Moon Godlike + Dumping Con + (High Might)] The endurance heals will make health more of an issue than dropping in combat.  High Might is recommended to get more out of the heals.\n \n[~+100% damage modifiers + Dual wield + Two weapon fighting talent vs 12 DR] Roughly when dual wield starts to gain ground next to a big 2 hander for dps.  Before then its a pretty non optimal choice for dps, but good for the speed of attacks and lack of overkill.  12 DR is what most monsters are at as well besides bosses at 28+ DR.\n \n[(Pale elf) + Shades, phantoms, spirit + Freeze DR]  Pale elf does it easier, tho wizards or paladins can also do it well enough via spells or darcozzi.  A lot less damage from one of the most annoying monsters.\n \n[Low Might Companions + Guns or crossbows]  Just my opinion, but guns are higher average damage and your companions tend to have low might scores giving an inflated \"slowness\" to combat a lot of times.  Reload animation can be interrupted with skill spam, but the low might is never overcome by weapon selection easily unless you're talking about guns.\n \n[Companions + Roles + Party composition]  1 tank, 1-2 bad off tanks, and 4-6 dps/support are roughly the numbers of what builds are possible.  Also there is no rogue, barbarian, or monk class.  So it might be encouraged to make an offtank.\n \n[Dexterity + Animation times]  Dex effects the actual attack animation AND recovery time.  Where as attack speed is only on the recovery time.  Reload (guns + crossbows) is never effected by either, except by Gunner, Surehand illa chant, and swift aim (ranger).\n \n[Debuffs stack for different sources]  Daze + weaken for example works.\n \n[Leather armor (Scale) + Pierce Proof + (Quality)]  An interesting way to get one of the better DRs vs 2 of the most common attacks (slash/pierce) while retaining a good recovery rate.  Alternatively, Scale is also good in this setup as it has a little more Freeze DR.\n \n[AI + Lowest deflection]  The monsters will target the closest thing they can reach with lowest deflection.  Its possible to number crunch so they target in a specific order for your party that way then.\n \n[Item Spoiler] (#s \"[Sanguine Plate + Shod in Faith + (Low Deflection)]  The new spell holding effects are 2/enc, so having heals + lower deflection + dmg from Frenzy is a great combination, as the person getting crit.\")\n \n \n**--Class (Includes anything that involve a class specific skill).--**\n \n* * B A R B A R I A N * *\n \n[Barbarian + Fire Godlike + Carnage]  Burning up for aoe melee attacks.\n \n[Barbarian + Threatening Presence + Brute Force + its a trap]  A NON COMBO:  as fortitude actually is higher for most monsters with high deflection.  That said, it helps land Fort effects like stunning blow from monk, but only gets \"ahead\" by other debuffs.\n \n[Barbarian + Human or Nature Godlike + Vengeful defeat + Second chance item]  +dmg or stats and kamikaze aoe damage\n \n \n* * C H A N T E R * *\n \n[Chanter + Any buff but not items]  Chants can stack with any buff with similar effects unlike spells where the highest overrides.  It seems chanter buffs go under \"item\" slot so while it stacks with different sources, a +reflex item and a +reflex chant, the highest wins out instead of stacking.\n \n[Chanter + Chanter(s) + Come Come Swift Winds of Death]  These stack up on enemies and start to melt faces at the beginning of the game.\n \n[Chanter + Frost Chant + (Fleet foot)]  Probably the only class that can reliably kite due to how monsters chase you and you drop frost traps.\n \n* * C I P H E R * *\n \n[Cipher Focus gains + (Fire Godlike) + Retaliate ] Burning/Retaliate up for your focus below 50%\n \n[Cipher + Front line position + Antipathetic Field + Targetting back row enemy] Is extremely high dps, like 25 every second to things in front of you and in melee with you even with 10 might.  Consider making Grieving Mother this build if you have enough CC and support effects as her stats are a bit odd and as a human, she gets some racial +dmg/accuracy when below 50% where melee tend to be.\n \n[Cipher + (Rogue + Escape) or (Monk + Longstrider)  or (Any tank + Fleet foot)+ Ectopsychic Echo]  The rogue can teleport behind the enemy line producing a huge echo effect much like the above.\n \n[Cipher  (Wizard)+ Opening with Confuse] Tenuous Grasp lvl 1 (Cipher) or Bewildering lvl 2 (Wizard), the effect is enemies engage the confused monster and beat them down.\n \n* * F I G H T E R * *\n\n[Fighter + high might + constant recovery] = larger passive endurance regen\n \n[Fighter + high might + wary defender + (two handed OR dual wield) + weapon spec & mastery] = frontline melee that tanks \"good enough for long enough\" while outputting accurate, consistent damage in a durable package that does not need babysitting.  Eder can do this easily.\n \n \n* * M O N K * *\n \n[Monk + Turning wheel + Transcendent Suffering + ITS A BUG!]  Turning wheel will overwrite the monk unarmed damage bonuses occasionally with no way to fix it except to go back to a previous save.\n \n[Monk + Wounds + Duration + (Turning wheel)]  Wounds roughly last \"10 seconds\" so Turning wheel is harder to stack up to higher levels unless they are dealt ~80 damage in less than 10 seconds with Lesser wounds to gain the max benefit. \n \n[Monk + Stunning + Enervating + Two weapon fighting +(Rogue)] See here:  http://forums.obsidi...-dual-wielding/  Or basically, you stun on first blow, then enervating blows has a much higher chance due to the debuff.  Rogue is nice for the synergy of sneak attack dmg.\n \n[Monk + Moon Godlike + Wounds + Torment's reach (or any wound using ability)] More wounds = more heals = more beatings that will continue until things are dead.\n \n[Monk + Long Stride + (Withdrawal Cape) + (Tank talents/stats) + (Flaggelent's Path) + (Cipher 3rd lvl Ectopsychic) + (Rooting Pain)] A tank that runs really fast past the front line and trails the ally beam behind them is amazing.  Extra bonus for getting hit = more wounds = rooting pain.\n \n[Monk + Turning wheel + Rooting Pain + ITS A TRAP]  Rooting pain is AoE damage, and does NOT get increased by Turning wheel\n \n[Monk + Offhand weapon + Unarmed main weapon] Attacks with offhand only, but with increased accuracy for \"both\".  This means for Torment's Reach, you can hit a bit harder/accurately at the cost of auto attacks.\n \n[Monk + Torment's Reach or Rooting Pain + (Cone) AoE + Turning wheel] is unaffected by +Turning wheel modifiers or accuracy as its aoe and a spell effect.\n \n[Monk + Might + Transcendent Suffering (aka unarmed damage)]  Might does double duty giving more +dmg for both the class passive and base damage.\n \n* * P A L A D I N * *\n \n[Paladin + Darcozzi + Fires of the Palace + Vulnerable attack + Scion of Flame]  Retaliation is a little harder to gain now, but the low damage of the fire retaliate means the above taken in that order will at least deal decent damage.  Also targets reflex which is good for shade killing.\n \n[Paladin + Flames of Devotion + Intense Flames + Burn Lash + (Guns) - (Scion of Flames)]  aka \"The Gunadin\" The way it checks vs the reduced DR, its more effective to have a bigger bonus to one category, specifically, fire for the paladin.  Scion of Flames seems to currently NOT work to enhance the lash effect.  Consider a Blunderbuss/Pallegina as well, as all 6 shots have the lash effect vs lowered DR and melts things.\n \n[Paladin + Zealous Charge + (Withdrawal Cape) + (Fleet Foot) + (Tanking stats) + (Cipher spell lvl 3 Ectopsychic)] aka \"The Runadin\" Monsters will generally latch onto one engager and remain there, the paladin can eat/take some disengage attacks while under their Cipher's friend's beam to provide a good nuke with little harm.\n \n[Paladin + Darcozzi + Inspiring Exhortation + Spells that provide accuracy]  One of the few ways to stack accuracy with other spells or effects.\n \n[Paladin + Ranged Arbalest/Crossbow + Righteous Soul (lvl 9)] will effortlessly 1 vs 1 immobile mushroom types of enemies ( Dank Spore // Swamp Spore //Giant dank spore) .. Once their mobile friends have been drawn away and disposed of ..  The 'shrooms can dominate the paladin for a second or two and then he shakes it off and keeps pumping them full of arrows 1 at a time ...Confusion is not that dangerous in this 1 vs 1 situation - dank spores have pathetic DPS .\n \n \n* * P R I E S T * *\n \n \n[Priest + Inspiring Radiance + Spells that provide accuracy]  One of the few ways to stack accuracy for the entire group.\n \n[Priest + Painful Interdiction + Barbarians with Threatening presence/Brute force + (Fortitude spells)] One per encounter (painful interdiction) and the barbarians in your group can hit much better along with fort effects.\n \n[Priest + Withdraw + Tank + Chokepoint or AoE Gather]  Use withdraw on a tank that is holding a choke point, or similarly gathered up for AoE.\n\n[Priest + Mechanics + Seal spells]  Affected by them.\n \n \n* * R A N G E R * *\n \n[Ranger Swift Aim + Wounding Shot + Melee + (Stalker's Link)]  They all work for melee.  Wounding shot seems odd, but hobble effect is stronger than prone for -reflex which can help your casters or similar.\n \n[Ranger Vicious Aim + Quickswitch + Guns + Swift Aim + (Stalker's Link) +(Swift/Steady) + (Island Aumua) + (Arms Bearer)]  One of the few ways the ranger keeps up competitively for accuracy and thus dps.  Uses the burst damage of the guns, and then swaps to Swift aim during reload of the last gun to provide consistent dps.  Arbalest > Arquebus and Blunderbuss > Pistol is roughly the same dps, though the first has less issues with DR and can possibly prone an enemy first.\n \n[Ranger + Engage item + Hold the line + Pet] Can have as many 5 engagement slots total, just as good as a Fighter.   Though the pet will die if its holding all the agro.\n \n[Ranger + Guns + Swift Aim + (Swift/steady) + (Surehand Ila from Chanter) + (Gunner)] Best in house dps with the big hitters like Arquebus and reload time.  Lacking +dmg modifiers, they rely on the heavier base weapons.\n \n[Ranger + Lion]  Bear is arguably one of the best of the worst pets, but Lion has a per encounter fear, along with faster movement that can come in handy for pulling or debufing.\n \n[Ranger + Backrow pet in formation+ level 5+]  Your pets tend to die, or get in the way of real melee.  Sometimes, its easiest to manage by keeping them out of the action or when others have firmly engaged.  OR keep them in the last row for formation so they have to \"catch up\" when a fight starts to easily manage them.\n \n[Ranger + interrupting blows + pet]  = pet also gets the increased interrupt ability with their attacks\n \n[Ranger + Stunning Arrows + Driving Flight + Pet] Secondary target will also be stunned.\n \n[Ranger + blunderbuss + driving flight + ITS A TRAP]  2 bullets instead of 6.  BUGGED\n \n[Ranger + Accurate Wounding Shot + Its a TRAP!]  Only effects the fortitude accuracy, not the initial strike.\n \n \n* * R O G U E * *\n \n[Rogue + Faster attacks + (Potion of Alacrity)] As damage modifiers can get pretty high on this class, faster = better.  While most of the others prefer slower weapons for the better base damage.  \n \n[Rogue + Deep wounds + Dump INT]  Unless the rogue is micro'd fully and even then its dubious on effectiveness, the DoT from the same source does NOT stack.  Hence, deep wounds will auto refresh on the same target, and there's really no need to up its duration as the rogue will most likely hit again before its up.\n \n \n* * W I Z A R D * *\n \n[Wizard spell lvl 3 Combusting wounds + Any Damage over time effect]  Each tick of the DoT will make Combust go off for more damage.\n \n[Wizard (druid) + Self buffs/weapons + No recovery time]  Self buffs have no recovery time and cast in less than a second.  Buffing is pretty quick.  Druid technically has spiritshift like this as well along with Firebrand.\n \n[Wizard spell lvl 3 Alacrity + Summoned weapon]  Comboing with the above, the weapons also swing faster as of 1.05 and with Alacrity wizards become even better beatsticks.\n \n[Wizard spell lvl 3 Alacrity + spells]  Alacrity effects recovery for everything.. spells and weapons.\n \n[Wizard spell lvl 4  Essential Phantom + spellbind items + (Armor)] has your \"worn spellbind\" items with full charges on cast.  For example, using a minor gloves of light endurance, even if the player had 0 charges, the phantom gets 3.  Note:  weapons/shield slot not included.  Note:  Armor is mentioned since it has the same DR when cast, which is why spellblades are so good in plate armor.\n \n[Wizard spell lvl 3 Minor Blights + Blast + (Penetrating Blast)+ (Dangerous Implements)]  The wand created by the spell does aoe damage,  and then blast does it again.  Becomes a crazy nuker this way and raw damage to self is neglible.  Also see Alacrity for faster attacks.\n \n[Wizard spell lvl 1 Parasitic Staff + Summon ]  Easy way to keep your wizard up by beat sticking your summons.  Not tested, but should work with melee summons + fire shield.  Optionally, [Item Spoiler] (#s \"Tidefall takes the place of this combo later.\")\n \n[Wizard + Deflection spells + Cautious attack talent + ITS A TRAP]  Highest wins, don't take this modal.\n \n \n----------------\n \nSome things weren't included like Rogue sneak attack as the in game description is accurate enough.

I'm in the first year of the grade and would like to study the 2nd year abroad while transitioning (a year and a half of wating is too much I think) if it's possible although I imagine that being a grade from Spain would have to be done from the start. I love English and I have no problem understanding and speaking it. I would say I would prefer to go abroad but inside Europe as America is too far away if there is any problem. I'm about to learn German so Germany would be also an option.\n\nMy ideal situation would be going away at the end of the summer maybe and starting studying next year, but one of my concerns is how would I do to get the treatment aproved and those legal things. As I'm quite young and I think being alone would be too hard for me to transition alone I would like to go to a place where there are more people like me or at least have a environment where I can feel safe.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4b9"}, {"score": 5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/378uo2/family_questions_advice_needed/", "id": "t3_378uo2", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "Family Questions: Advice Needed!", "timecreated": 1432586441.0, "subreddit": "exmormon", "selftext": "[deleted]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0gj"}, {"score": 4246, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3789vc/i_am_voice_actress_grey_delislegriffin_you_might/", "id": "t3_3789vc", "author": "Grey_DeLisle", "title": "I am voice actress Grey DeLisle-Griffin - you might know me as Azula from Avatar: The Last Airbender, Daphne from Scooby Doo, Vicky from The Fairly OddParents, Lois Lane / Wonder Woman, and most recently, \"Setsu Oiwa\" in Studio Ghibli's When Marnie Was There.

What is this? Is this spotting? Implantation bleeding? If it's AF, it's very odd. I've never just had a pinkish tinge before starting my period. It always starts on full out gush-mode (sorry. lol). I stuck a q-tip up there thinking that it would come out slightly red because AF is just being a weirdo this month, but no, Just a pink color. \n\n  I know the only option here is to wait and see if AF REALLY starts up and this is just an odd fluke, but I just wanted some opinions.

I really enjoy the game mechanics and I've been dying for a good FPS for my new PS4. Now that I've reached the level cap in the demo I'm considering buying the game outright but I have some reservations. First off the game and the community is honestly a bit dense and intimidating for me. It also doesn't help that Destiny seems to be so incredibly polarizing! In general though I don't mind the whole \"repetitive grind aspect\" of the game, I actually find gameplay like that a bit relaxing. I used to play a ton of RPGs back in the day and currently very casually enjoy Diablo 3, although I've never played MMOs. \n\nMy only concern is that I literally don't have any friends who own or plan to own the game. Realistically how much of this game can you solo yourself? At what point to do you need to work with other players? Co-Op can be awesome if you're with a good group of people, but there is no chance that I'm going to put up with running through a mission with a bunch of abusive 15 year olds calling me a noob. It seems like every person is a maxed out level 32 and convincing people to help out a lower level player sounds like more trouble than its worth.\n\nAlso how essential are the expansion packs?\n\nTL;DR Can a filthy casual enjoy Destiny and get his money's worth without knowing anyone?\n\nI REALLY appreciate any help here! Thanks!\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who responded, you guys answered my questions perfectly.

I cannot remember a single analyst or pundit who took the position that the Seahawks receivers are just fine as they are and that our (very few) failures last season were due to other problems.\n\nNow that the draft is over, we can see how the front office viewed the team's \"problem\" at wide receiver based upon the players they acquired. We drafted one WR and signed another as an UDFA. \n\nOur second pick was Tyler Lockett. In their comments after the draft, PCJS described his contributions as a return man in glowing terms. His prowess as a wide receiver was secondary.\n\nAustin Hill, the WR we signed after the draft, was a prolific receiver for Arizona before tearing his ACL in the spring of 2013. He has not recovered from that injury (and may never fully recover) as he was third in receiving on his own team after gaining a second/third round grade in the 2013 draft, had he gone pro. \n\nIn rounds 5/6/7 of this draft potential upgrades at the WR receiver remained on the board. Personal favorites Tre McBride and Darren Waller were late 7th round picks. \n\nAfter their draft, PCJS clearly do not believe that the problem at WR requires a drastic influx of young talent. They must believe that our deficiencies in the pass game can be fully addressed by the additions of Jimmy and a top return man who is also a WR. \n\nI hope they are right, but I'm not sure I agree with them. I'd love a split end who can get separation (Kearse always has a defender in his back pocket and makes his living off of making catches with very high degrees of difficulty). I'd love a flanker who can stretch the field and get separation AT THE SAME TIME (maybe Lockett is that player?).\n\nAm I way off base?

When I'm not studying, I like learning about business, and was always interested in being an entrepreneur. Also I'm not a native speaker so excuse my grammar. When I first came to Reddit, I read a lot of useful studies about ecommerce and affiliate sites and decided to create one. I took it as a personal challenge, I was curious if I could do what others did. Here's my story:\n\n**Basic info:** At the end of March I bought my domain and hosting and started building [my site.](http://runnersheadphone.com) My goal was to build a site that earns decent money, due to the fact that I barely knew anything about bulding an affiliate site. I wanted to write reviews, blog posts, build backlinks and handle social media. I had a budget of *50$*.\n\n**Time allocation**: I spent 80 hours working on the site approximately.\n\n20 hours - Writing reviews and articles.\n\n40 hours - Handling social media\n\n10 hours - Learning how to build backlinks\n\n5 hours - Actually building backlinks\n\n5 hours - Designing\n\n\nAs you can see, I spent most of my time with twitter (I'll write about it later). I wrote 6 reviews and 5 blog posts, all 250-500 words. I spent some time studying because I felt like I needed and I still need it. I chose a really hard niche to dominate, so if I want to make good money, I'll have to learn a lot more in the future. Also I feel like I'm doing a really bad job in building backlinks, will try to change it next month. One thing I'm satisfied with is the design. I feel like its pretty nice, even though I'm still not a pro.\n\n**Social Media:** I'm proud of my results when it comes to social media. I chose twitter as my main platform, and didn't regret it. In 1 month's time, I got over 3300 followers, all interested in my niche. Around 20% of my traffic comes from twitter, and bounce rate is the lowest here as well. I get 1-2 messages each day asking which product to buy, and I find it really profitable to devote enough time to manage your twitter/facebook/instagram accounts.\n\n**Traffic:** Here's a [Graph](http://i.imgur.com/3ewbXFU.png) so you can see what I'm talking about. I think bounce rate is way too high, I'll have to reduce it somehow. On the other hand, I didn't expect 4400 unique visitors in the first month, I'm impressed by how different methods can affect my statistics, I learned a lot in April.\n\n**Earnings:**\n\nAs a wise man once said, here's the part that most of you came to see.\n\n[Earnings.](http://i.imgur.com/8u7TC5M.png)\n\nI didn't expect even the half of it, honestly. I'm really proud of my results, but there's a long way to go.\n\n*Invested in April:* 50$\n\n*Income in April:* 70$\n\n*Profit:* **20$**\n\n\n**Next month plans:** \n\n- Build and learn how to build backlinks\n\n- Reduce bounce rate\n\n- Stay motivated\n\nI want to thank /r/Entrepreneur for helping a lot and motivating and teaching most of the things I used in the previous month. Also, I'd like to thank /u/Humblesalesman for his case studies. I'd like to stress again that I'm still learning website building and marketing, so don't go hard on me. \n\n**Have a nice day, stay awesome!**", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo"}, {"score": 2, "url": "http://freerice.com/content-group/bo-sunguardians", "id": "t3_34qd0a", "author": "leilialula", "title": "Join the Team!

Anyways;\n\n\nDynamic Events.\nThey would make rounds play out much differently, making the gameplay much more interesting. Here are some examples;\n\n\nYou're on a map that has a medium-sized mountains on the sides of a valley, something like [this](https://trustingortripping.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/valley.jpg) but **rocky**    There's a random chance that awhile moving in the valley, that boulders/rocks will fall from both rocky mountains, most of the rocks going right down the middle, damaging/killing anyone that happens to be right in the middle.  After the rocks stop falling, each side is blocked off by the pile of rocks and boulders.  The team could decide to go up the mountain and try to pass the pile of rocks, or go inside a small cave that leads outside around the pile. \n\n________________________________________\n\nAnother example is weather.  Awhile playing on a map(s), there is a random chance that it will start raining, lightly or heavily.  Perhaps with lightning as well.  This could make the gameplay more interesting.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nAnother example;\nyour on a map with a river, that involves you crossing it by going in it or taking some sort of a bridge to get to the enemy unless you wait for the enemy to come to you. There would be a chance that the weather will change to heavy rain, causing the river to go a tad bit crazy, making it go faster, and anyone in the river will start to get carried by it until they reach the waterfall, falling to their death (They would be able to get out of the river as it is doing this, but as they move to the shore they will still be getting moved by it)\n\n_______________________________\n\nMaybe some sort of player-controlled event as well.  This map would have a forest in it, and if a player has access to any fire-starting type of weapons (like a firepot, not sure if that will be added though) or a torch you can get, you can throw it on a tree in the forest and slowly cause some of the forest to catch on fire, most likely making the teams get out of the forest so you can fight them easier without banging into trees, or to get some of your enemies out of hiding.\n____________________________________\n\nYour on a map that starts out raining lightly, but has a chance to rain heavily. On this map there would be a muddy canal that you can go into (Shallow water at first), and you would need to go into it to get to the enemy's side. There's a chance that the rain can go into heavy, then a sound is heard to give the players in that would be in the canal at the time a warning, a loud, fast moving water sound in the distance. Then suddenly, a wave of water comes hurdling down from the direction the canal is moving in, and splashes into  anyone in the canal, moving the player with it, and damaging him/her slowly until they drown. \n________________________________________\n\n\nSo what do you guys think about Dynamic Events?\nI really think they could spice up how rounds play out, and could make it a lot funner.", "subreddit_id": "t5_33ed9"}, {"score": 20, "url": "http://strawpoll.me/4269545", "id": "t3_34qly4", "author": "_FRANKENSTEIN_", "title": "POLL: Are you Male or Female?", "timecreated": 1430677229.0, "subreddit": "thebutton", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_36buk"}, {"score": 4257, "url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPU5qFJAJGg&sns=em", "id": "t3_34ppf7", "author": "BryanWake", "title": "For all the disappointed casual boxing fans still longing for more excitement after last night's bout, I give you Roy Jones Jr., the cockiest pound-for-pound fighter I've ever seen...", "timecreated": 1430658112.0, "subreddit": "videos", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e"}, {"score": 0, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/CSk84QL.jpg", "id": "t3_34qy0m", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "PsBattle: Photoshopped my dog and called it double trouble!", "timecreated": 1430683509.0, "subreddit": "photoshopbattles", "selftext": "[deleted]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tecy"}, {"score": 1, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/9s2kE3n.jpg", "id": "t3_34qwfq", "author": "silentsecrets", "title": "On the underside of a 2015 Nissan Altima, it's plastic and it's loose.", "timecreated": 1430682684.0, "subreddit": "whatisthisthing", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3kh"}, {"score": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/34phth/rfifa_the_daily_squad_thread_may_03_2015/", "id": "t3_34phth", "author": "AutoModerator", "title": "/r/FIFA: The Daily Squad Thread -- May 03, 2015", "timecreated": 1430650821.0, "subreddit": "FIFA", "selftext": "*This thread is for* ***all posts*** related to squads. \n\n**Do you have a squad that's just killing it?** \n\nPost below and give us a review of what's working and who might benefit from building it.\n\n**Do you have a squad that you want critiqued?** \n\nPost it and tell us what you want to improve upon.\n\n**Do you need a squad built?** \n\nFill in the sample below and let others find or create a team that fits your purpose.

Unfortunately, her larger stomach made it difficult for her to reach around and tie/buckle the bathing suits behind her back. \n\nSo I'm standing outside holding clothes that we were going to buy for our two daughters when she asks me to come in there the help her out. Of course, without hesitation, I enter. \n\nNow I want to pause for a second to note that there was no employee there to delegate the entrance to these rooms. Also, they were, of course, separate rooms with curtains and junk.\n\nFast forward 5 bathing suits later when she decides she has to go get more because the ones she had didn't fit. I tell her I will come with her but  she insist that she will only be a few minutes and that I stay. \n\nFive minutes later, a woman knocks on the wall next to the stall I am in, and the following unfolds.\n\n\"Is anyone in there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh. Are-are you a man?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"OK. You know this is a woman's dressing room, right?\"\n\n\"Oh. Yeah. It's no problem. My fiance is just outside looking for more swimsuits and I am holding the room for her. She will be back momentarily.\"\n\n\"Sir. Will you please come out of the dressing room?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nIt is at this point that I realize what is happening. Now I'm terrified and embarrassed and just decide to wait for my fiance to come back.\n\nSo now the lady is telling all of the women in the surrounding dressing rooms that there is a guy in the dressing room and to not come out. She proceeds to call the police and tell them that there is a guy that won't leave the dressing room, so they are on their way.\n\n5 minutes go by and my fiance is nowhere to be found. I finally leave the room to go find hrr, and there are people taking pictures of my as I walk out. After the walk of shame, I wander around the store calling out my fiance's name, and can't find her. \n\nThe police have made it by now, so I approach him and was introduced by the store manager as the creeper.

I'll try to make it quick.  About 3 years ago I found who I thought was the love of my life. We talked for a year becoming friends and then went on to date and lasted 2 years .  I considered him to be my first true love and  he said he felt the same and would often talk about how \"he's never felt anywhere close like this for anyone\",&  \" I'd love to marry and spend he rest of my life with you\" and blah blah and was more the aggressor in us getting together and wanting us to take bigger steps like moving in and such. I kinda could tell getting to know him that he wasn't the type into relationships and all.\n    I knew in the back of my mind, but I found out he was a huge cheater. I found out he was  finding dudes off apps like grindr, screwing gay \"friends\", had a secret dating profile on a site, craigslist, and cruising in the park. Needless to say I was devastated and honestly I still feel like i'm jaded from having all that crap happen.\n\nHe admitted it first time on new years and Id had suspicions going through his phone ( I thought it was all just talk because he would lie about where he worked and family and such and I thought maybe be liked the fantasy and just harmless flirting online) . I forgave him but three groups of times of catching him (one guy found or groups), I broke it off.\n\n\n\nTHEN::::   We haven't spoken for 2 years. Mutual decision. He said he'd always love me and was always hoping I'd come back.  About a week ago I get a message from some random guy and  I see he's gay and notice he's from my ex's city. It started out mostly small talk until he asks if im dating anyone, about my last relationship and so on. I only sat *\" we Just didn't work out. He was an asshole and treated me like shit.\"*  and he later goes on to inform me that he's the new guy with my ex and was just curious about me since i was an ex.\n\nThis guy is kinda young and kinda fearlessly asks why we broke up and if there was anything to watch out for. The first thing that came to mind was me going through the same thing because my brain was going through loops with these tiny red flags going on but being under the spell of love, so to speak, and thinking it'd be weird messaging his ex and seeming immature and desperate. (his story of what happened to his ex changed from \"mutual breakup \" to \" his ex finding him cheating and then them opening their relationship because guy wanted to stay but the x just wouldn't be honest..  Guy A hookups with a friend, falls in love, then ditched him.\")\n\nHalf of me wants to tell this guy to run for the hills and give details and shit about how he'll cheat, what he'd done, the lies,how he cheating even when our sex life was on fire and so forth. If I was getting a guy and he'd had a bad past I'd wish someone would tell me the truth and save me the heartache.\nYet, on the other hand, I really don't want to get involved or possible ruin something that could be good for them. After I broke it off he cried alot and said things like It was the worst mistake of his life and how he'd ruined the only thing he'd ever loved and he'd never do it again because of how stupid it was the risk a relationship for bad sex and  blah blah blblalalablahh  and I kind of think maybe he could change. I think people can make mistakes and change but I'm hesitant. Usually you can tell alot about people from their past,\n\nTLDR: Ex was a  huge cheater. His new bf asks about any red flags. Do you tell him about his history of lying and cheating??\nWhat should I do?  If they asked, Do you tell the new guy about the ex ??\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vgfw"}, {"score": 780, "url": "http://gfycat.com/AcrobaticVelvetyAcaciarat", "id": "t3_34prw6", "author": "IHavePourGrammer", "title": "Nadia Jay", "timecreated": 1430660119.0, "subreddit": "60fpsporn", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_31gq1"}, {"score": 6, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/z1BIkU0.png", "id": "t3_34pvdg", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "Whats the best channel to be on?

I paid all of my fees to the USPTO, my lawyer is pro bono, and now I'm playing the waiting game for the approvals.  I received a letter in the mail from the \"Trademark Office\" stating that I needed to pay an additional $385 in filing fees in order to protect my mark and prevent others from filing similar marks.  I was angry and then I started to think about it logically.  My first call was to a friend who is also starting a business.  He had received something similar in the mail a few weeks before I did.  He meant to pay the \"bill\" but kept putting it off.  I then called my lawyer who then confirmed that it was a scam.  \n\n   If you receive anything in the mail in regards to a patent or mark you are filing, do not pay them, investigate it first.  The Trademark Office will not solicit additional filing or protection fees through the mail.   \n   In most cases, the scammer won't be required to give you your money back.  The USPTO can't do anything about these bandits but they do have recommendations.

I just finished my own reading of DotL tonight and thought it would be fun to share things I found interesting when comparing the two.\n\n**=====**\n\n[Dying of the Light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_of_the_Light) is a stand alone novel that is set in a fictional future that sees humanity moving outside of Earth and living on various other planets across the galaxies. GRRM has wrote other stories set in the same universe, like \"A Song for Lya\" and \"With Morning Comes Mistfall.\" Here's the description of the novel as read on the back:\n\n> A whisperjewel has summoned Dirk t'Larien to Worlorn, and a love he thinks he lost. But Worlorn isn't the world Dirk imagined, and Gwen Delvano is no longer the woman he once knew. She is bound to another man, and to a dying planet that is trapped in twilight. Gwen needs Dirk's protection, and he will do anything to keep her safe, even if it means challenging the barbaric man who as claimed her. But an impenetrable veil of secrecy surrounds them all, and it's becoming impossible for Dirk to distinguish between his allies and his enemies. In this dangerous triangle, one is hurtling toward escape, another toward revenge, and the last toward a brutal, untimely demise. \n\n\n**=====**\n\n~Similarities~\n\n* The first immediate comparison that I saw was how this story was about a very tricky love triangle akin to what ASOIAF was originally with Jon, Arya, and Tyrion. In DotL Dirk tries to \"rescue\" Gwen, who is -in simpler terms- married to another man. Although ASOIAF has evolved greatly, it is interesting to think \"what if\" and remained the same. In DotL it is revealed that **(spoiler)** all of the conflict between Dirk and this other man was all fabricated by a completely different person, a man who was in love with Gwen and wanted him himself. Dirk becomes friends with his rival, and this other man, in conclusion to a series of complex events so much so to simplify here, hangs himself in regret. \n\n* Being cold being connected to the idea of dying. Worlorn is a dying planet, and is constantly being described as a cold place. The book's ambiguous ending, which is left you wondering or not Dirk lives, ends with this: \n> No starlight ran down his blade as he lifted it and reached out to touch Bretan's. The wind was blowing. It was very cold.\n\n It made me think of Jon Snow's last chapter and \"only the cold.\"\n\n* 'Bad guys' like to flay things. In DotL the quote unquote 'bad guys' like to flay their human prey (Boltons anyone?) Not only this, but they like to hunt people with their hounds, which remind me of Ramsay and his dogs, although the hounds in this book are grossly big rat things. It is seen as part of their culture and tradition. In the end they lose.\n\n* The mentioning of songs and wolves! Already seen in his first novel, GRRM incorporates the usage of wolves and songs whether that being in describing something, or using it as part of a planet's name. One thing I found funny is that one of the aircars in the story was modeled to look like a wolf's head. Also there is the singing city Lamiya-Bailis, which when the wind passes through it it makes a song. I recall there being an island in the ASOIAF world that shared this \"singing ability\" as well?\n\n* Breaking oaths/tradition for the greater good. One thing that the characters in DotL are continuously challenged with is the idea of preserving their honor while being able to do good. (See how that worked for Ned Stark?) Anyways, in this book those that survive in the end are the characters that end up breaking these things, realizing the \"greater good\" is what truly mattered.  \n\n* Sandor Clegane's roots stretch back to this book with the character Braith Bretan. (I didn't realize this until I google'd it) Both men are described similarly, not only in the manner of the way they talk, but how they have similar facial features as well with the scarring and everything. However Bretan's missing eye is replaced by a glowing stone instead, so there's that. They're also fundamentally different characters, but their character designs are quite similar.\n\n* Last but not least these characters have long ass names, holy crap!! You thought Dany's chapters were confusing enough? Try to remember who the hell \"Lorimaar Reln Winterfox high-*Larteyn* Arkellor\" is. (I'm serious, that's his name, lolz.)\n\n**=====**\n\nSo that's all what I noticed. I'm curious what you guys think. Have you guys read Dying of the Light and noticed similarities? Have you read any other book outside of the ASOIAF universe wrote by GRRM that made you think back to Westeros and its people?\n\nI hope you enjoyed the read at the very least! :)\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r2o9"}, {"score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GolfGTI/comments/351ycu/northern_va_questions/", "id": "t3_351ycu", "author": "DocMichaels", "title": "Northern VA questions", "timecreated": 1430916952.0, "subreddit": "GolfGTI", "selftext": "Hey folks!

Due to mainly having introverted friends and belonging to too many friend groups, I would typically spend my evenings and weekends at home. My parents were painfully strict and religious. I knew that they would not approve of my circle of friends at the time and to be honest I was embarrassed. I did not want my friends to see that I, the lewd and eccentric Astral, grew up in a home filled with Jesus paintings with parents who still tried to talk to her using baby voices. This further contributed to my social isolation. It didn't help that my parents refused to allow me to hang out with friends without first meeting and approving of their parents. I honestly didn't mind my social isolation though. I actually enjoy being alone.\n\nDuring this period of time, I poured my energy and boredom into anything I could get my hands on. I was a compulsive reader, often reading a book a night. Because of this behavior, I was able to read up to 500 words per minute in 7th grade. (averaging around 400 or so though) In a two year period of time, I filled over 36 thick notebooks with drawings, written works, and other random ideas. I mentally created multiple novels. I tried drawing my own comics. I was basically trying to desperately satiate my growing boredom. And you know what? It fucking worked. \n\nFlash forwards a couple years. My over-protective, over-baring parents had basically banned me from using the internet without their permission (and constant monitoring). For years, my friends had been going online without me. I felt like I was missing out on some great mystical power. When I was in a sophomore in high school my parents gave me a laptop. I was in multiple Advanced Placement courses and desperately needed one. They obviously still kept their no-internet rule, but of course I didn't fucking follow it. I was soon thrust into a world of cat videos and bad memes. It was like all those shitty fantasy novels I was reading at the time. I was a fish out of water and this was a fresh new world to explore. Soon my free time was slowly eaten up by the internet. I stopped reading. I stopped drawing. I stopped writing. I stopped brainstorming. I stopped creating in general. I'd come home from school, force myself to do my homework, and then mindlessly browse the internet. I wasn't even looking at porn (my parent's main concern, even above pedophiles in chatrooms). In the past I would stay up until 3 am writing, drawing, and coming up with random ass inventions. At this point in my life (and even now), I would stay up until 3 am doing absolutely nothing. I would mainly just refresh a forum I was active on and watch stupid videos. \n\nWhile I love the internet, I loathe it. I love how easy it is to access new information. Being able to connect with a wide range of people from different walks of life has been life changing. At the same time, the internet has killed my creativity, motivation, and focus. I am always the most productive when I am alone and bored out of my mind; when there is nothing to distract me. I will typically focus on my goal at the time to avoid being bored. The internet has basically destroyed the concept of \"alone time\" for me. Why be alone and focus on something when I can watch random youtube videos, research stupid shit, write long ass reddit posts, and talk to internet friends?\n\nAnyone else find that the internet has actually become a hindrance to them? I used to think it was the greatest addition to my life, but I am coming to realize that it has actually done more harm than good in my personal life. The internet might be the best and worst invention for ENTPs. It satisfies our lust for knowledge, while being a constant distraction.\n\n**tl;dr**: When I was alone I used to be creative and get shit done. Now when I am alone, I go online and do absolutely nothing. It might be less to do with being an ENTP and more to do with my over-bearing parents.

About that buff immigration officer, he probably doesn\u2019t recognise U and was just saying \u201cYOU, what role do you play?\u201d (And with the western-chinese accent). Most readers probably didn\u2019t catch this intentional joke (T/N credit mr_delphi) as well so I\u2019d like to clarify it first (T/N Except reddit lol).\n\nLate last night, with the players comfort during MSI in mind, the four of us went and bought some daily necessities for them. After picking out the items at the supermarket, we were stopped outside the store. Yep, you guessed it, we were being robbed. Just like a scene in an American TV show. An african-american male (T/N uhh\u2026 I\u2019m not making this up), appeared and blocked us off. \u201cHey, You, XXXX give me money\u201d I think was probably along the lines of what he said. I took a quick glance at the guy and thought, Him alone? has the balls to mug the four of us? Do you know Chinese Kungfu? While keeping an eye on him, I kept walking. The exchange students in front of us said to themselves: \u201cWhat is this luck, we actually ran into a robber (T/N He mentions the race again but it\u2019s not as offensive in Chinese), RUN!\u201d Although I didn\u2019t really agree with them (I was thinking: These kids haven\u2019t seen anything. This is nothing compared to the Guang Zhou train station 10 years ago!), I was running with all my might and trying to keep up with the students in front of me. As we were about to run past the robber, I realised his right hand was reaching into his pockets. I suddenly tensed up, he\u2019s reaching for his weapon! I suddenly made a impulse reaction. I pulled out the newly purchased \u201cHead and Shoulders\u201d Shampoo from the shopping bag with a solid grip. Although the way I held the bottle seemed like I was equipping a knife, my heart was already set\u2026 No matter what kind of weapon he uses\u2026\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll 100% give him all the cash I have on hand! In the end, the robber seemed a bit frightened, guess he was defeated by our vigour, and we safely got back on our car. On the car, everyone else began discussing if he actually had a weapon. Me? I was already one step ahead and was already processing everything that just happened, his movements, my reactions, in the form of a movie. In my mind the robber had long lost to the might of my Head and Shoulders shampoo bottle. \n\nOk, lets get back on topic! This morning, all the players seemed different from their usual selves. What do I mean by this? They all went nice and early to the restaurant for breakfast. \n\nhttp://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupshnci8j30hs0noaey.jpg\n\nhttp://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupsm3wtkj30hs0nowid.jpg\n\nThis is a very abnormal occurrence, which probably shows that they haven\u2019t adapted to the time difference yet. Considering they woke up at this hour, it\u2019s probably safe to assume that practice today won\u2019t be very effective. After breakfast, a Riot employee took us to the stadium. The event is held at Florida State\u2019s basketball stadium. For me, an average college basketball stadium should only seat 3000 people\u2026 However, this massive stadium can actually seat 18,000! The venue is incredibly impressive, and the fans attending will probably enjoy it a lot. And their campus even has a 80,000 seater Football field! Think it\u2019s probably safe to consider this incredibly impressive! The air and view in Tallahassee is really nice. All the teams and players all took a nice stroll from the hotel to the event grounds. The areas around the hotel and stadiums all have a really comfortable vibe to them\u2026 \n\n\u2026Kinda like my hometown Hainan.\n\nhttp://ww2.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupt5sepcj30zk1hcdy0.jpg\n\nhttp://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupt6zufxj30no0hsdn4.jpg\n\nhttp://ww4.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupt819mlj30hs0no0y9.jpg\n\nhttp://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupt9kwt3j30hs0nodo4.jpg\n\nhttp://ww4.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1eruptbj3mzj31hc0zkwqz.jpg\n\nAt the training area, the players connected their equipment in preparation for scrims. From the establishment of EDG until now, there are many teams that we have never played before, not even in scrims. Two of the teams that booked us for long scrims for today and tomorrow The first unfamiliar opponent played us at 2PM. \n\nhttp://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupu4e07cj30hs0noq7m.jpg\n(T/N FNC FNC FNC!)\n\nLets all try and guess who the other team is? Scrims were all very serious. Everyone wanted to perform well in their first scrims in NA.\n\nhttp://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupv43t1wj30no0hsaf8.jpg\n\nhttp://ww4.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupv4n4khj30hs0nojwv.jpg\n\nhttp://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupv4pphoj30hs0nojvr.jpg\n\nThe first set of scrims went by in a flash. But what was obvious was that the players were still not in top condition (T/N in terms of their health, I guess due to the jet lag etc.). In the next set of scrims, the time difference heavily affected our regular training. Our scrim against TSM hastily ended and we dragged ourselves back to the hotel. Starting tomorrow, we\u2019ll have to be more aggressive in recovering from the jet lag and tiredness. There\u2019s only 1 day from the start of MSI and there\u2019s not much time left. As we exit the basketball stadium, we see that there are people outside still rushing to finish the last minute preparations for the event. To hold a successful competition is indeed not an easy thing to do.\n\nhttp://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupvjs3e7j30hs0nowhr.jpg\n\nLastly, we\u2019d like to thank BigPomelo (T/N ex. OMG) for coming over to visit\n\nhttp://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/00608Hs5gw1erupvripqvj30no0hs0xf.jpg\n\nToday\u2019s theme was recovery. Hopefully tomorrow we\u2019ll have a complete team that is at full strength. See you guys tomorrow! I didn\u2019t take many photos today, \u5c0f\u7533, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s another staff member of EDG (T/N maybe the photographer?), took many photos of the players expressions and actions.

Even when there's a new season on the horizon, during the off season the content is usually nothing spectacular. After a certain point, everything worth discussing has been discussed, every joke worth making has been milked to death, and what your left with is fanart. And that's just for the off season. We are in the off *series*. There isn't anything major to look forward to and discuss outside the comics, and considering how little discussion was had on \"The Rift\", I have to doubt that alone would \"save\" anything. \n\nSo we can blame a ship, or recognize that this subreddit's quality taking a nose dive post-finale was always inevitable no matter what happened and that it probably can't be blamed on one specific thing. \n\nThe reason so much Korrasami stuff is making the front page is because nothing else is being posted that anyone cares to see. That's as much the people bitching about its fault as it is Korrasami shipper's. Considering how important the relationship is for some people, its hardly surprising its popular on here. And just bitching about it in the comments is only serving to make the subreddit even shittier.  \n\nIf you think this subreddit is dead, move on. Whatever little quality you think it has anymore is only weighed down by bitching about a ship. The number one reason I don't come here anymore is the volatile atmosphere caused by people trying to place blame on its declining quality.

He wields a trident with wave shield charges, has hydraulic push and animal messenger as spell-like abilities, and his summoner dip gives him an eidolon that looks kind of like a leafy seadragon; NOTE: My DM has allowed me to use Boon Companion for the eidolon so that the dip isn't totally worthless. The idea is he's basically supposed to be Aquaman. \n\nThe rest of the team are an Aasimar Oracle, Kitsune Bard, Tiefling Bloodrager, and we had a Pixie Mysterious Stranger Gunslinger but she died so that player is now an Elf Rogue. Of the rest of the team only the Pixie was a custom race and class archetype, but we're all relatively non-vanilla characters (until the Elf Rogue now).\n\nWe've got another campaign we'll be starting soon, where I will be a Summoner Synthesist whose eidolon is meant to be an alien biotech suit, sort of like the manga character Guyver. The only other character in the group I know off hand is going to be a Necromancer (I assume a Cleric thing), but his character is interesting because he's a child and, due to his backstory, isn't actually aware that what he does is evil (allowing him to get away with not being evil alignment).\n\nI've been coming up with more character ideas lately than I'll ever get to actually play, but I'm interested to hear about other peoples atypical characters or groups as well.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2trms"}, {"score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/35wn92/leblancs_problem_isnt_distortion_its_her_chains/", "id": "t3_35wn92", "author": "TerminaV", "title": "Leblanc's Problem isn't Distortion.

I was hoping to ask for some advice from the outside here, trying to help put my emotions in check.\n\n\nSome fast background. I live in an apartment with my fiancee and we're sick and tired of apartment life. We've lived together in this apartment for a year and before this we lived in a duplex together for 2 years in college and good lord are we ready to do laundry without needing quarters and not have to worry about neighbors deciding 11:00PM is a good time to vacuum on a weeknight.\n\nBefore anyone asks, we have our emergency fund. We do have student loan debts/car payment but those are easily within our grasp. Between the two of us we're pulling in $120,000 gross. Both of us are currently at our company match for 401K, but that's mostly because we've been saving for a wedding/down payment on car/down payment on house while not completely depleting an emergency fund.\n\nSo, my fiancee and I are looking at a house. We've been looking for a few months now, and haven't really found a lot that we liked. We're being a little picky. I won't budge on a 2 car garage, she won't budge on having an extra bedroom for guests, we want a yard, etc. We were really hoping to move out this summer while the weather is nice.\n\nWe finally found a place we -adored- in a really good location. Has everything we both want. The drive from work is farther, but uses back roads instead of in-town roads, so the time to drive to work is actually shorter. We love the town, it's close to a wine club we're a part of, etc. etc. we adore it.\n\nAt the asking price of $160,000 it's still within what we can afford, utilities/taxes/insurance all considered in there.\n\nHowever it's a 3 bed 2 bath place. 1600 sq ft not including the basement which is unfinished but gigantic. Realistically the actual value of this home is probably closer to the $148,000 range.\n\nUnfortunately the sellers don't agree (of course) and that's fine and dandy. We love it, and we are ok with paying a little higher for it.\n\nBut the sellers final offer has been made at $156,000. They came down 4K from asking price =\\. Such a beautiful home but it's been on the market for a year. I had expected something to be very wrong with it in the inspection considering how much we love the place, but we've definitely come to realize the reason it's been on the market so long is these sellers being so unreasonable with the price of their home.\n\nAt this point I've been reduced to doing the math, trying to justify why this would be ok. Honest to goodness, I want to buy the place anyway. (Well, what I really want to do is to ignore the fact that they stated this is their final offer and throw another number at them with a statement of \"Yeah, this is why you can't sell this place\". But I don't know how much of a faux pas this is). But my realtor is telling me these guys are being unreasonable and we should probably just walk. My parents are saying it too. So are my coworkers. My friends have no idea, we're all in the same boat of being fresh out of school.\n\nSo I guess I'm looking to you guys Reddit. What would you do here?

I also think many blue pillers would be surprised to find out that there is very little discussion about the topic on TRP.\n\nSome of the reasons I think women use sex to control men are the fact that:\n\n1. women as a group engage in the majority of slut shaming. \n\n2. Feminists actively fight to keep sex work of any kind illegal and punish the women that engage in it.\n\n3. A long list of self reported cases from seduction forums where a frigid woman suddenly starts having sex with her partner again when she discovers she might lose him, or a woman starts shit testing or otherwise trying to manipulate his feelings and he wont have it. 'red pillers' think the woman had lost her attraction and they have suddenly rekindled it, or 'passing the test' turns her on. *I* think the woman is using sex to manipulate him.\n\n4. women talking about using sex to reward men for their behavior such as \"chore play\"\n\netc. \n\nSo what does everyone else think?", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ya42"}, {"score": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/35wp18/whats_your_typical_subway_order/", "id": "t3_35wp18", "author": "BubbaShrimp666", "title": "What's your typical Subway order?", "timecreated": 1431574032.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "[removed]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"score": 97, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/35vr96/private_sub_rbrokenmom_access_to_it/", "id": "t3_35vr96", "author": "NursingInPublic", "title": "Private sub /r/brokenmom & access to it", "timecreated": 1431556406.0, "subreddit": "breakingmom", "selftext": "Hi all you [wonderful moms](http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m52/grilledcheesesandwich/tv%20moms/momoverboard.jpg)!\n\nAs some of you may have heard, there is now a private sub /r/brokenmom available if you want to discuss stuff that you prefer not to have all of reddit able to read.

As I hope you would all understand and want.\n\nIn order to gain access to /r/BrokenMom you will need to message the mods (Of BrokenMom not BreakingMom), or message myself (/u/NursingInPublic) or /u/Deep_Vein_thrombosis for access.  \n\nIf you are **NOT** an active user on BreakingMom **OR** you are using a new account or new throwaway account we are asking for you to provide proof of who you are.  How can you provide proof??  There are 2 ways to do this.\n\n1. Send us a picture of yourself with your username so we know you are indeed a [woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqh3tMZhOXQ).  Bonus points if you include a messy house in your pic.  ;)  **How to send a picture, if a mod requests one??** *Upload a picture to imgur or a similar photo sharing site and send the mod a link.  Picture must include your username on a paper in the picture.  Thanks!*\n\n2. If you are moving to a new username and have an active user name you can message us via your active username and let us know your new one that needs to be approved.  I know people are changing names frequently because of nosy spouses/family so this is a good option if you are a regular user but being forced to switch.\n\n\nIf you have any [questions](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-01/7/18/enhanced/webdr03/anigif_enhanced-1476-1420673891-28.gif), please feel free to ask!

This dream was incredibly special to me. I was in this incredible mountainous town my subconscious conjured up.  I was skateboarding around the town and came across a cabin situated on a large cliff overlooking a vast landscape of beautiful mountains, valleys and gorges. I entered the cabin and was greeted by a group sitting around a large carpet with just enough room for one more person to complete the full circle.  I took my place and sat down. One of the figures asked me if I was ready to tune in, I was so excited for the prospects of an amazing trip I immediately obliged.  He passed around some blotter to all of us in the room and I popped the paper in my mouth.  I remember waiting in this little cabin for a while waiting for the drug to kick in.  The focus of everyone seemed to be on me and I began saying I couldn't feel any effects of the drug on me.  One of the figures looked at me and told me to relax.  I laid my head down for a moment and felt that tingling sensation of excitement waiting for the hallucinogens to kick in. BAM! I opened my eyes and right as I felt the LSD hit me I became lucid. I looked around at everyone and they were all smiling and the one that spoke before made a remark along the lines of \"It's about time you woke up to your dreams\"  The roof of the cabin dissipated into the cosmos and I flew into the sky never looking back towards earth.

The winner will be chosen tomorrow (May 4th) at 7PM EST.\n\n The winner will be notified through a Reddit Private Message.

The Offensive Line sucked, and the backfield had some injuries through the season. Since then we cut Reggie Bush and left the draft with a guard, guard/center, tackle, and Ameer Abdulla at RB. Granted, these are all rookies, other than the 32 yo guard/center, so their impact is yet to be seen. With our revamped O-Line, a superb, young RB, I am speculating the Ameer could be a value RB. My only fears are that carries may be split. Joique Bell is a powerhouse, change-of-pace back that is a beast. Then there is Theo Riddick who is more there for passing.\n\nWhat does everyone think? I see the Lions run game taking a leap, but will it be relevant for fantasy owners. I would like to see Ameer be the feature back, but I am afraid of him and Joique splitting carries.

I'm an artist by trade, so some of these stories may be lacking in certain areas, and I apologize for that. Considering how vivid the memories are, I was actually debating on whether I should draw out some of the more prominent scenes in order to help. I wish I could take a mental photograph as even with my artistic abilities, I don't think I can quite capture the fear.\n\n As my last post mentioned, I ended up moving out and away from that house. Night terrors still gripped me in fear, but they weren't the same as the ones I had in the house. In fact, they changed to giant spiders above my head, but once I woke up in full I realized it was the Dreamcatcher I had hanging above my bed. \n\n\nI won't go into lengthy details about my partners, but I had moved in with my girlfriend, then we broke up, and then I met my future husband. We dated, then moved in together, and eventually he proposed. Because we still lived close to my parents, the night before our wedding I stayed at their house because of the ole tradition of the husband not seeing the wife before she walks down the aisle. Just so happened, we were also getting married in the Masonic Lodge down the street from where my parents lived because my step-dad was a Mason there.\n\nI packed my things a bit nervously, but said my goodbyes. My fiance was a Christian man who didn't believe in ghosts or paranormal and had even scoffed at my the stories of previous events at this house. Explaining my trepidation would have gotten me a smirk and a pat on the ass along with, \"Go on\", so I didn't bother telling him that my nerves weren't so much about \"YAY! this is our big day!\" but, \"Crap, I don't want to stay there.\" Convenience and necessity made it so that I had to, and it was one night, what could go wrong?\n\nEverything went as normal, I got there, we hugged, I put my things in the livingroom since my step-brother had taken over my old room. This relieved some of the tension I was feeling as part of me thought that what I had experienced was tied to that room. I had hoped that sleeping on the couch would help me get a better nights sleep even with the pre-marriage jitters tap dancing in my stomach. I'm prone to anxiety anyway, so this little blessing made it a bit easier to fall asleep that night.\n\nShockingly, I did fall asleep, but it wasn't long before I found myself startled awake. Mind you, I was half asleep and feel as if i'm a co-pilot watching from the inside of a plane being steered by someone else. I'm aware of what i'm doing, but even though it feels like i'm in an out of body experience, I was still IN my body, I just wasn't in control of it. \n\nI watched as I sat up and immediately looked at the door. He was there, but he didn't have anywhere to sleep because I was on the couch. For some reason my brain said that I needed to get up and offer it to him to be polite. I stood up and said, \"You should sleep here...\". \"He\" had seen me look at him and was already walking around the coffee table towards me, so as I got up and walked past him, I felt the brush of someone walking so close you can just barely feel their energy. I felt a definite \"whoosh\" but nothing fast, just a gentle reminder of fabric and then I heard him get on the couch, I even recall a slight grunt.\n\nI wandered over to the recliner, pushed out the foot rest and curled up for the remainder of the night. I do recall waking up once, however, and very confused about why I was on the recliner, when my head rolled over and my eyes glimpsed a figure on the couch. \"Oh, right, he needed somewhere to sleep.\" To which I was immediately placated by the thought that i'd given up my sleeping spot to someone else and I had relocated. \n\nThe next morning I wake up, again, confused and wondering why I was in the recliner. I then remembered giving up my spot on the couch, but no one was there. Part of me wondered if maybe my step-dad was being sentimental and decided to check on me last night and slept some of the night out in the livingroom, but mom confirmed he'd been in bed with her all night. That would have been creepy in and of itself since me and him didn't get along too well, but I didn't want to factor anything out. I told her what had happened and she said, \"I remember you having this happen before, and ya know, since you moved out, when i'm in the livingroom watching TV, I hear someone walk in the hallway. Even Chilton (our dog) will get up and start barking at things and nothing is there.\"\n\nA bit validated by this, I filed it away and saved it for a rainy day with friends if Ghost Stories ever came up.\n\nFast forward about a year, and my parents are having some financial difficulties. I really didn't want to move back into that house, but I wanted to help them and me and the husband were now living in a bad part of town due to him being in the military and wanting to be close to base. The house was about a 30-45 minute drive depending on what route you took, but it was manageable. He agreed to help and so we set about taking over payments for my parents and then moved in not too long after.\n\nWhen we finally got all their stuff out and ours in, I made sure that we didn't use my old bedroom. We stuck all of our things in the master bedroom and made my old bedroom the catch-all for the crap we hadn't unpacked yet. \n\nWe settled in, but fear was still there. Would it be better now that I was in a different room? Worse? Or would it just be my usual night terrors that haunted me?\n\nIt didn't take long to find out, and whoever \"he\" was, he was back with a vengeance. I'm not sure if it was because I didn't take up my old room again, or if it was because I was there with another man, but he was not happy.\n\nThere would be nights that I woke up and saw \"him\" standing in the doorway. He was extremely angry and the night terror ended with him coming into the room and sort of disappearing before he got to the bed. However, it wasn't that he was gone, I knew he was on the other side of it, waiting. \n\nOther nights were the spider again, but mostly it was always him right outside our doorway, furious. I'd never had feelings attached to these before, but now it was one of the more prominent things I could remember because it triggered such a primal fear in me.\n\nThat's when the worst happened. It's a night terror I will never forget. I cannot get the image or the feeling out of my mind.\n\nWe had gone to bed and my husband had fallen asleep. I'm prone to insomnia because of the night terrors. My brain just doesn't want to shut off out of fear and probably preservation. I tend to stay up reading reddit or other sources just to keep myself occupied until I can't hold out any longer. It rarely saves me, but I hold out as long as I can.\n\nI finally fall asleep, but like the ones before, I suddenly wake up. Two inches from my face is the most ghastly, hideous visage i've ever seen. Even worse than the supposedly dead woman from before. This face was grey, almost stone like in appearance, but wet. It oozed. It's eye sockets were empty of eyeballs and gaping black holes stared at me. It's mouth hung up, jagged teeth and a grin to rival even the Joker, but worse. From all this, you'd think that would be the worst part? No, it was the feeling of malice. Of death. Of murder. It registered in my brain that from where it was, it had to be perched on my husbands back in order to get this sort of angle over me, and that's when I panicked. I screamed and cried for a good thirty minutes before my husband finally got me to calm down.\n\nHere's the worst part. That feeling I felt, I distinctly remember not associating it with me, but with my husband. Whoever he was, he wasn't going to hurt me, he was going to hurt my husband.\n\nIt wasn't long after this incident that we ended up moving back closer to base. Eventually my husband would cheat on me and we would divorce. Because of this and having retold the stories so many times, a friend of mine who was Pagan, mentioned that maybe this Ghost guy was attached to me and men in my life made him jealous. I thought back to the times when \"he\" was more violent, and recalled that the night I thought he was going to hit me, my boyfriend at the time was in England. Upon his return we ended up breaking up because he admitted he'd gone on the trip to see if he wanted to date this girl who had gone too. (It was a school thing for his college stuff.) I was sad then, but didn't make the connection.\n\nSo this thing looks as though it's going to hit me, and then my boyfriend breaks up with me. Then it scares me awake with a feeling of malice and shortly there after my husband cheats on me and we divorce. I'd hesitate to say that \"he\" had something to do with those, but in both cases the significant other was no where near that house and I _know_ he's anchored to it if anything.\n\nWell, I thought I knew. This is where it sort of, I dunno, gets even weirder.\n\nI divorce and I meet a guy a bit later, we start dating and then things turn serious. Eventually we move in together. Night terrors are the usual, but now, in this new house, i'm having the different kinds of night terrors again.\n\nI wake up and there's someone at the foot of the bed, but it's not \"him\" it's someone else. They're walking around and they're going to hurt my boyfriend. I scream and start flinging my pillow. I've never gotten violent with these before, but for some reason my fight or flight kicked in and my fight was strong with this one.\n\nMy boyfriend didn't wake up, so I shook him to try to wake him because the figure had made it to his side and I was worried it had done something. He was cold to the touch and my half asleep brain thought he was legitimately dead. I shook and shook, tears streaming down my face. I wailed and begged for him to wake up, and finally he rolls over and says, \"wut\" all groggy. I'm flooded with relief and then anger. His tone was one of frustration and here I thought he had been dead. I was worried! How dare he! I went back to sleep somehow, and the next day asked him what happened. He said he didn't know, just that I woke him up from screaming at him. (I'd later find out that he was actually awake, but my screaming was so bad, he didn't want to move for fear of whatever it was getting him lol. Jerk.)\n\nThe next one, which was both scary and oddly comforting, was so very strange. I was startled awake just like every night terror ever. Except now I had taken to sleeping with a blind fold on. No lie, I was down to my last resort. \"If I can't see it, it can't see me.\" This would have worked if my half asleep mind hadn't betrayed me. I flung the cover off my eyes and at the foot of my bed were two half formed figures. A redhead and an old balding man. They were laughing, but not just laughing, they were cackling. The feeling I got was that they were enjoying tormenting me. Waking me up every night with different things, but that's when I turned to check on my husband and there \"he\" was. But now he was transformed. His skin was grey, his hair was a deep shade of blue so dark it was almost black and his eyes were black too but reflected a crescent moon that made up the iris. I gasped, not because it scared me, but seeing him not only put me at ease, it comforted me. I was in awe not just of him being there, but of his beauty. From where he was sitting, it appeared as if he was on the other side of my boyfriend, sitting up with his legs tucked up. He put his finger to his lips and all I heard was \"shhhhhh\" before I instantly fell back to sleep.\n\nI woke up and thought, \"Is he protecting me now? How did he get here?!?!\" \n\nI didn't know, but eventually we moved to an apartment where stuff started getting knocked over. This pagan friend said I should contact him and try to help him go home or find rest. \n\nOne day I was driving and I just felt like he was there with me, so I said out loud, \"Look, I can't keep calling you \"he\" or \"it\". You need a name so we can do this proper.\" It took a split second before I finally said, \"Adam. I'll call you Adam.\"\n\nThings died down after that and I noticed at night if I said, \"Adam, please behave,\" the night terrors weren't so bad.\n\nCurious, I went online to a blog and posed a question to friends about determining the name of the guy who died in the car accident. I knew the last name of the folks who lived in the house before us, Pruitt, and gave an address, but I didn't know where to look to find out anything else. A friend posted back asking specifics, which I gave her. She knew the whole story so when she replied to me, chills ran over my spine and I teared up a bit. She'd found a name:\n\nEdgar **A**. Pruitt\n\nI don't know what the A stands for, or how she found it. I trust her, so I didn't think to ask, but part of me has always wanted to know what the A was. Is it Adam?", "subreddit_id": "t5_2raed"}, {"score": 158, "url": "http://skiretehfox.deviantart.com/art/Yellow-and-Black-with-some-red-and-white-402948605", "id": "t3_34qr5s", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "More bumblebee?

As of a few days ago I had the opportunity to conduct an interview in an inner city school with a pretty nasty reputation.  I went in to the interview with the full willingness to take on the challenges that teaching in this environment would entail.  I conducted my interview and as far as I can tell everything went well.  At the close of the interview they asked whether or not I'd be interested in doing a sample lesson for a live class in the future, another good sign IMO.  When I told this story to my father who actually attended this high school in the 70's and worked in the area for much of his life he was extremely concerned.  He explained the many hazards that would be common if I were to accept the position.  He explained that it is not just a matter of teaching in the school that is potentially dangerous, but commuting to the area each day (I don't drive and would be riding my bike to and from school).  He has seen and been affiliated with people involved with gangs in the area and knows first hand the hazards of being in that environment.  \n\nI would like very much to consider his warnings dated, as the area has undoubtedly improved since the 90's, the time since when he was last in the area and working.  Nevertheless, I am now apprehensive about moving forward and taking the position.  I am currently employed in a different field and would be taking a leap of faith to try and secure and succeed in a teaching position.  Ultimately, I suppose I am looking for any advice from you teachers in regards to this issue. On the sensible advice from a friend I am doing research now into the actual crime rates and conditions of the city, as well as trying to make contact with a teacher already employed at this school.  Thanks for your time\n\ntl;dr need advice on whether or not to take a teaching position in a potentially dangerous area/school. \n\nUpdate: Well I never got a call back, so it looks like I didn't make the cut.  However, I sincerely appreciate everyone's input because I may once again be confronted with this situation.  Ultimately though I don't think I would have taken the position.  In the end I began to realize just how much taking on the challenge would affect me and my lifestyle currently.  Again thanks everyone for your honesty and insights.\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqcs"}, {"score": 92, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/jqQ8PoC.gifv", "id": "t3_34rna4", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "Armisael's larval form has been found [X-Post /r/WTF]", "timecreated": 1430696543.0, "subreddit": "evangelion", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r6ex"}, {"score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/knifeclub/comments/34ruwp/gifv_anodizing_titanium_saw_this_over_on/", "id": "t3_34ruwp", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "gifv Anodizing Titanium saw this over on r/woahdude and had to repost here", "timecreated": 1430700713.0, "subreddit": "knifeclub", "selftext": "[deleted]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfn"}, {"score": 412, "url": "https://twitter.com/cowboysnation/status/595014808526843906", "id": "t3_34rv2n", "author": "daytonamike", "title": "Cowboys new DE Randy Gregory is going to wear DeMarcus Ware's old #94.", "timecreated": 1430700798.0, "subreddit": "nfl", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmg3"}, {"score": 13, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whatstheword/comments/34rqk6/wtw_for_being_afraid_of_the_power_that_oneself_has/", "id": "t3_34rqk6", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "WTW for being afraid of the power that oneself has?", "timecreated": 1430698314.0, "subreddit": "whatstheword", "selftext": "For example, if you have lots of power over someone because they're your responsibility and/or they love you very much and you're afraid of the power that you have over them that could hurt them.

Bought the extra 100 packs with the 10k gold I had saved. 2800 packs total. Statistics were all pretty right on for number of legendaries/epics/rares. I definitely got way lucky on golden legendaries however coming in at 21. Below are the screenshots of the dust and number of unique \"gold\" cards i opened. \n\nhttps://imageshack.us/i/eycl4DDLp , https://imageshack.us/i/idFpxnYBj\n\n\nUpdate 1: I wanted to open all the packs tonight, but alas I only got through 1,150 of them. Still have 1,000 left (500 of each set). I've gotten pretty lucky with golden legendaries so far. From what I remember I've gotten the following:\n\nYsera x 2,\nDeathwing,\nOnyxia,\nAlexstraza,\nVancleef,\nMogur The Ogre,\nCaptain Greenskin,\nNozdorumu,\nIllidan,\nGruul,\n\nWith a total of ~ 1700 decks opened so far my current dust count is ~146k\n\nhttps://imageshack.us/i/p1kRWJblj\n\nThis doesn't include the golden legendaries and most of the new gold cards I've opened which you can see from the numbers on the tabs. I'd say I've gotten close or slightly above average so far. I'll finish opening the last 1000 tomorrow night and post the exact number of what cards I disenchant when I finish. \n\nOriginal Post:\n\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img913/6703/MJsTpT.jpg\n\nI've been wanting all gold decks for a while. Every month I try to calculate how much it would cost. I decided to throw $2500 bucks at it and see if I could at least get all the competitive cards. Here's to a long night of pack opening!! WISH ME LUCK\n\n600 more bought so $3,200 spent. I will update with total dust. I'm sitting on 10k gold so I may throw that into the pot too. I want all gold decks.. what can I say. \n\n\n\nEdit: This got way more attention than I was expecting (I expected it would be overlooked and vanish). I went to bed last night after opening the first 500 as I realized at my current rate it would be 5am before I finished opening them all and I did have work in the morning.\n\n I have 2158 packs left after making my second purchase before sleep (I knew I wouldn't be willing to splurge again for a while). I'll try to open them all tonight and get back with dust count and legendary/epic/rare count. \n\nAnd since everyone seems to be talking about golden legendaries! I've opened 5 so far (1 last night): Tyrion, Sylvanas, Alexstraza, Vol'jin, and Deathwing. I already had every card before doing this. \n\nAnd now back to work! \n\nEdit 2: Not sure why people would think anyone would bother faking this, but I suppose reddit always needs proof! Here's a screenshot of my email this morning (I doubt those order numbers matter but you never know). There were 45 emails so it took up more than the whole screen, but you can clearly see the last 10 done \"before bed\". \n\nhttps://imageshack.us/i/exO4gkgIj\n\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t"}, {"score": 386, "url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-e3WSwNfalDg/VUDUe2XjXlI/AAAAAAAAFQI/T8PW4Qzk0Q0/w661-h577-no/Nexus%2B5%2B2015%2Bblack.jpg", "id": "t3_356agr", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "Nexus 5 2015 concept.

Something's really been bothering me lately. Last week, I was having dinner with my mom and her friend when her friend suddenly asked, \"Sooo when are you gonna let your daughter wear makeup?\" My mom said that it's my choice not to put on makeup. Her friend glanced at me disapprovingly and replied, \"Oh... Well I just think it's common decency, you know? Like you're respecting other people by presenting yourself well.\" I was taken aback, and quite frankly, my feelings were hurt. Gee lady, I'm terribly sorry that my choice to not put on makeup is offending you ://. Then yesterday, my friend started ranting about how people \"looked like hobos\" at our final exams. \"I was tired too but at least I had the *decency* to swipe on some mascara. *Ugh* .\" I felt extremely awkward because I'm the only one in my friend group who doesn't wear makeup.\n\n Am I being too sensitive about it? I've always thought that makeup was a way to feel more confident about yourself, not to solely impress others. And I may or may not be stupid for thinking that this is such a big deal. It's just something that's been bothering me lately. \n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the gold!

I was just trying to get everything out as best as I could. \n\n\nMy boyfriend (B) and I have been together for over 3.5 years now. About 4 months ago we broke up due to a lot of issues we were having. Towards the end the relationship was filled with fighting, we just couldn\u2019t seem to connect and we were making each other miserable. In short we broke up and decided it was time to see other people. About 2 months ago we ended up talking and realized we still loved each other. When we got back together he told me he had slept with several other girls, which is fine because I slept with a few guys as well. However he then disclosed one of the girls was his \u2018friend\u2019 (K) who had been trying to sleep with B since she met him. She is still part of his life and its making me insecure.\n\n\n**Backstory:**\n\n\nK met B during his freshman year of college because they lived on the same floor and they became friends. A few months into their friendship K asked B if he was in an open relationship or wanted to be in one. He said no, that he was in a committed monogamous relationship and wasn\u2019t interested. He told me about this the day it happened **3 YEARS AGO** and I thought that would be that. She had been curious and had a bit of a crush my boyfriend but I thought she would respect the fact he told her no. Not at all. Every few months K would ask B if he had changed his mind about having sex with her, if he wanted to be in an open relationship like she was,  that she would even let me try out her boyfriend if I absolutely needed to so they could have a go, ect. About a year ago she even snuck into his room while drunk and tried to give him a hand job when he was sleeping. He woke up when she got into his bed and freaked out. Despite this she was still a part of his life.\n\n\n After each incident we would pretty much have the same argument more or less.  That her friendship and presence in his life was making me uncomfortable and if he could perhaps limit contact or only hang out with her around other people. He would tell me no, that he wasn\u2019t going to throw away a friendship because I was jealous/insecure and that I needed to get over it. He would then tell me he wasn\u2019t attracted to her, that he loved me, that I needed to trust him, ect. I would tell him it wasn\u2019t about trust. It was about the fact K had no respect for our relationship and I wasn\u2019t ok with her constantly trying to talk him into sleeping with her. That I felt when he was disregarding my feelings about K and by telling me to get over it he was choosing his friendship with her over me. He would reply with something along the lines that i was trying to control him and he wasn\u2019t going to let me choose who was in his life and who wasn\u2019t. And that would be that till she did it again a few months later.\n\n\nTowards the end of it all I was pretty resentful of K (and had now become jealous/insecure like he had originally accused me of) and would get annoyed if B had been hanging out alone with K. And although we broke up for other reasons I feel that K had contributed too it. \n\n\n**Present:**\nWe\u2019ve been back together a few months and Ive been trying to not let the fact B slept with K bother. Because at this point she is a sore spot and I am now jealous and insecure of her presences in his life. Im angry that she finally got want she\u2019s been after for 3 years. I know he had no obligation to me and we both thought we were completely finished when it happened but it still pisses me off. Since we got back together K has yet to be heard from and I assumed it was because she got in his pants ad was done with him. Wrong again. \n\n\nI was playing a game on his phone today when a message from K flashed across the screen. So I looked. I personally don\u2019t see this as an invasion of privacy because we have always been on each other\u2019s phones and looked at texts for one another. We have never had anything to hide so our cell phones have always been open books. \n\n\nHer message said: *hey B sorry I\u2019ve been afk from your life recently I was just really disappointed in your decision to start seeing OP again. But I\u2019m ready to let it go. I know you guys are back together but its whatever. Im forgetting what you look like want to help me remember ;)?*\n\n\nI was extremely livid after reading that message and asked him what the hell was going on. He said that while we were broken up he slept with K a handful of times a few weeks before we started talking again. He said that the day after we had started talking again K had texted him and asked if he wanted to come over for sex. He had told her no that he had started talking to me and he wanted to give us another chance. K got really angry and told him he was making a bad decision and B told her he felt he wasn\u2019t and that he loved me and wanted a future with me. She never replied and he never texted her after that.\n\n\nI started crying and told him I couldn\u2019t do this anymore with K. That she was already hitting on him again and I already had to many on going issues with K and now shes undermining our relationship again; but has the added bonus of saying she\u2019s already had you once what\u2019s the difference for going again.  This time instead of arguing with me he asked if I would like for him to cut off all contact with K. I asked him why wasn\u2019t he just telling me to get over like he use to. B replied that he had been wrong in the past to push my feelings aside for his friendship. That he could see how deep my issues with K ran and he felt partially responsible for them. That things were different because she had now become an ex-sexual partner and not just a friend. And if I was truly uncomfortable with K in his life he\u2019d stop talking to her because making sure I was secure and happy in our relationship was his number one priority. \n\n\n**So my questions for you guys is:**\n\n\n**1)** Is it ok for me to take him up on his offer to stop talking to K? I do want her out of our lives but I don\u2019t want him to resent me later on down the road.\n**2)**How do I deal with my insecurity and jealousy regarding the fact he slept with K? Because knowing it happened makes me sick/angry sometimes and I don\u2019t know how to not feel this way. I don\u2019t want these feelings to ruin our relationship.\n**3)**I don\u2019t get it guys, She has her own boyfriend why does she want mine so badly?\n\n\n**TL:DR**\nMy boyfriends friend was constantly trying to get him to sleep with her since they met. We fought about her presence in his life and how uncomfortable it made me and he told me to get over it. We broke up eventually and he slept with her. Now we are back together and she\u2019s still trying to get him to sleep with her again. He offered to cut off contact with her. Should I take him up on this? What if he resents me for it later on? How do I deal with my insecurities over him sleeping with her?  \n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn"}, {"score": 10, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/356aop/what_is_an_unspoken_rule_of_dayz/", "id": "t3_356aop", "author": "Sirlance47", "title": "What is an unspoken rule of DayZ?", "timecreated": 1431006287.0, "subreddit": "dayz", "selftext": "Title", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ty3s"}, {"score": 721, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/356g9v/serious_girlfriend_25f_of_a_year_and_a_half_has/", "id": "t3_356g9v", "author": "furybuilt", "title": "Serious girlfriend (25f) of a year and a half has masters degree and 150k in debt.

Before we got married, I came into quite a bit of money, over $1m. My parents told me I needed to set up a Trust to protect my assets (so in the case of a future divorce, among other things, I would be protected). I didn't feel I had much say at the time, and did agree with them to a certain degree so it was set up. Now I've run into some conflict. We've found a house and my father wants me to put it in the name of the trust, which would essentially keep it separate property from my husband like the rest of the money. My husband thinks this is unfair to him and wants the house to be in our names. My husband earns a good salary. I used to earn maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of what he makes, although now I'm a stay-at-home mother and do not have any income. My plans to return to work are uncertain.\n\nI suppose my husband thinks that if we get divorced someday he should get half of everything. My parents obviously think I should keep everything I had prior to us getting married. My husband had very little savings prior to us getting married. I honestly do not know what the fairer answer is when it comes to pre-nups, trusts, divorce, etc. It just stresses me out. Maybe in the case of a old billionaire marrying a bimbo golddigger the answer is easier, but what about normal people who make a life together over many years? What should happen when you get divorced? My husband argues that all the years we have been together he has not put much money aside in savings, because of the big account balance I have. I think this is a fair point however he also has a steady salary and job with good future prospects and I do not (which is what my father argues). This is money he did not earn and was given to me by my family. On the other hand, I didn't earn the money either. We've been together for a long time however I can't claim to know the future anymore than anyone else.\n\nI don't know how to please my family without upsetting my husband and vice versa. I'm a grown woman and feel like I should be able to make my own decisions and mistakes apart from my parents. At the same time this money is mine because of them and I feel like they have to have a say, too. All I want is to please everyone yet I am struggling to see how there can be a real compromise in this situation.

I work in a grocery store, albeit a fancy one, but I'm still just a regular clerk. Why some people would want to trust important questions regarding their health and safety to a random clerk is beyond me. Apparently the allure of near minimum wage customer service is just too tempting to pass up for medical and agricultural experts.\n\nSo one busy afternoon this rough looking old guy wanders in and approaches the first clerk he sees: me. He says, \"Do you know about mushrooms?\" I reply that I knew some, waiting to see what his question was. We sell several types of fresh and dry mushrooms for cooking and usually people want to know which they should use in their recipe.\n\n\nHe pulls a crumpled sandwich bag of his coat pocket and presents me with some strange looking mushrooms and fragments of mushrooms. \"Are these safe to eat?\" \n\n\nSir, I cannot answer that for you. They don't look like any kind of edible mushroom that I am aware of and I would advise not eating them.\n\n\n\"I am 85 years old and I've made it this far. I'm going to eat them. I don't think it will kill me. What do you think?\"\n\n\nSir, even if I knew what kind of mushroom that was, legally I can't identify it or recommend that you eat it.\n\n\nSo he makes a beeline for another employee a few feet away and tries to badger them into telling him that it is safe to eat. He goes from employee to employee with no luck. He comes back to me a few minutes later, still holding out the mushrooms.\n\n\n\"I think they look like baby portobellos.\"\n\n\nSir, baby portobello look look more like this. I show him something on the shelf. I do not think that this is a portobello. I only know about mushrooms that we sell. I am not familiar with local edible mushrooms and again, I cannot legally advise you to eat these. I strongly recommend you do not. You would be better off finding a book or online guide to identifying mushrooms. He mumbled something about not trusting those sources.\n\n\nFinally he gives up. He seemed a little dejected but he told me that he would toss them.  He leaves.\n\n\nFin.\n\n\nWhat the actual fuck though, you guys. He trusts some random grocery clerk to identify his weird mushrooms but won't trust an edible mushroom guide. Somehow because I sell mushrooms I should know about any kind that exists? I even told him I don't know anything about this and he still kept asking. This sort of madness happens all of the time with people bringing in their sick kids or lifting their shirt to show a rash to get a diagnoses. Ugh.\n\nHe also asked me about the white button mushrooms. He said if he saw that in the woods he wouldn't trust it. How do they know for sure that is the right mushroom. Had to inform him that most mushrooms sold in grocery stores are farmed.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t2zt"}, {"score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37ghim/reddit_what_age_did_you_move_out_of_your_first/", "id": "t3_37ghim", "author": "ThermoPacMan", "title": "Reddit, what age did you move out of your first home, and why?", "timecreated": 1432733378.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i"}, {"score": 215, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/37e0kd/ama_about_my_final_fantasy_xiv_heavensward_handson/", "id": "t3_37e0kd", "author": "Archernick", "title": "AmA about my Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward hands-on!", "timecreated": 1432681318.0, "subreddit": "ffxiv", "selftext": "***IMPORTANT EDIT: Just want to be clear, in case I didn't before, everything I spoke of was technically in development, and so is subject to change.

I don't know if these were GITM or if I had someone just messing with me. \n\nSo, one October evening at about 8 or 9 pm, I got this phone call. I answered it and the person didn't say anything. I kept saying \"hello\" over and over because I could hear breathing on the other end. Sometimes when my boyfriend calls our connections fail and we can't hear each other, so I thought maybe it was just him at first. Btw, the call was a private number. Finally, I ended the call and called my boyfriend- and it wasn't him. While I was talking to him, I was getting another call coming through, again from a private number. So I hurried up and clicked over and said hello. Just long dead silence. So, I just sat there, on the line for awhile, in hopes that the person would say something. They never did. Just long dead silence or occasion small breathing noises. Finally, I told the person to please let me know who you are and why you are calling. Nothing still. So I hung up. \n\nThese calls kept coming and coming. Back to back. I stopped answering them, so the person would just leave long voicemails. Usually just dead silence, with occasional breathing sounds. Then once what sounded almost like the buzzing of a chainsaw or something similar.\n\n The whole thing really freaked me out. I was getting scared for my own life honestly. Barely anyone knew my number except a few family members and a few close friends. There was only one person that I thought it could have been, a guy friend of mine who lived in Australia, (I'm in U.S.) but there is no way of knowing that for sure.\n\n This happened for about two weeks straight, every night around the same time, back to back calls about 5-10 in a row (once it was about twenty in a row.) Then they suddenly stopped. \n\nBut then...I'd be texting my friends or whomever, and I started getting these strange repeat texts. They were like word salads and would repeat things that were previously said by the person I'd be texting with. I even called some of my friends to ask if they noticed all the repeat texts they were sending, but they had no idea what I was talking about. It was really strange. It was like the repeat texts had some sort of intelligence behind it too...even though they were copied from other previous texts. The repeats would reply to something I'd say up to ten times and the replies would make sense to what I'd be saying. This happened for a good long time because I couldn't afford to get a new phone yet. Finally, I was able to get a new phone and got rid of that one. I also got a new phone number as well. Ever since then, it all stopped.\n\n Thanks for listening. I still think about it from time to time and wonder what the hell was going on but I'll probably never know...maybe my phone was screwing up but that still doesn't explain the unknown multiple caller.

Since then, I've received dozens of messages pleading with me to reconsider, dozens more detailing just how much you love me. Those hurt, a lot. \n\nI'm worried no one else will feel as passionate about me as you do; more than that, I'm worried that you will sit in your house alone, talking to no one, going no where, and hold out hope that this is just another silly break-up over something stupid that will blow over. \n\nWe didn't have a good relationship. You focus on only the nice times we had, and ignore every other day. We fought *often.* The fights were bad. We're hundreds of miles apart and I could deal with that, but there was never talk about being closer together. There were so many little habits of mine that annoyed you; I felt like so many quirks and habits of mine died away because you would get annoyed over them. You were annoyed with me so often.\n\nDid you forget all of that? Why are you romanticizing what we had when our day-to-day interaction was just... not filled with as much happiness as we both deserve?\n\nI miss you, still. I love you. I worry about you. I wish I could comfort you, because I hear texts going off as I type this, just now, and it's you... you're scared, and worried, too. We were a terrible couple. This was the right thing to do. It would be so much easier if you agreed.\n\nI feel guilty for being ready to move on. I've known it was over for a while, and I'm sorry I healed a little without you ever realizing I had given it so much thought.\n\nI probably won't reply to your texts. It's cruel to drag it out, reply, because I know you, and you'll hold out hope for as long as I keep replying. I wish I didn't have to ignore you, you're my best friend, still, and I miss you... and I worry about you... and even though I know I did the right thing, seeing you talk about us so sweetly makes me temporarily forget that we were not a good couple at all.\n\nI hope you find someone who is better suited to you than I was.

I'm super... duper.. cereal**\n\nReposting, think I submitted too late last night.\n\nSo... I've been troubleshooting this for about 2 months. It's an odd issue but I'll just lay it out the best I can.\n\nI recently purchased a Samsung HU7250 55' Curved UHD display for my computer. Why? I do multimedia and the extra screen real estate is useful, I was interested in the new tech, and figured it would be fun to play some games on.\n\n**The problem:** When I connect the TV to my computer, enable UHD and set the frequency to 60hz the screen starts to stutter (Like a quick shake) it gets progressively worse and then the green/gray flashes start (Tiny green/gray bars going vertically on my screen. Green if it's in YCbCr444 mode Gray if it's in RGB) when I put the frequency down to 30hz it works fine. When I disable UHD it works fine.\n\n**Hardware Information:**\n\n* CPU - Intel i7 5820k\n* Memory - 16GB DDR4 3000\n* Motherboard - ASUS X99 Deluxe\n* Video Cards - 2x nVidia EVGA GTX 970 SC's 4GB\n* PSU - 750w NZXT\n\n**Troubleshooting:** Contacted Samsung/EVGA support (Not very useful as you'd think, basically blamed the issues on each other)\n\n* Enabled UHD/Disabled UHD\n* Tried all HDMI ports\n* Tried 3 (New) HDMI cables, all rated high speed\n* Replaced the SLi Bridge on my computer\n* Disabled SLi \n* Tried every possible configuration within nVidia control panel\n* Reformatted and installed Windows 7\n* Reformatted and installed Windows 8.1\n* Reformatted and installed Windows 10\n* Used MonInfo and created an EDIP Override\n* Disabled all post processing within the TV\n* Tried nVidia drivers ranging from 344-352\n* Tried Tweakforce 3rd party drivers\n* Installed latest firmware updates for the TV\n* Monitored temperatures\n* Checked for radio/em interference\n* Tested PSU\n* Changed display mode to Game/PC/PC DVI.. and pretty much everything else.\n\nThere is probably more I've done but can't remember.\n\n\n**Partial Solutions:** Here is the weird part, this TV HAS worked in 4k UHD 60hz. How? Fuck if I know, I seem to stumble across a series of steps by accident and it works flawlessly for a few days. Then out of no where it starts screwing up again. The only thing I can say is I have not noticed anything specific I do to get it to work. One time I disabled UHD on another port and it worked, another time I unpluged the TV and plugged it back in and it worked, I've also gotten it to work after the EDIP change but none of these fix actions worked a second time.\n\nI'm at my wits end guys, I'm well past the return date and aside from this one issue the TV works fine, and this issue is intermittent so I think I'm screwing something up..

Be sure to read or just skip to the end for a big angle that is rumored, improvised a bit by me.\n\nThe two chamber matches should kick off, because it would be a pain to keep lifting it up and down if they aren't back to back, plus they are 2 great matches to start the show off on a good note.\n\nFirst match should be the IC Title Chamber match. All the participants come out, and Ziggler and Rusev start off.\nOut Third is Ryback, Fourth is Barrett, Fifth is Truth, and Sixth is Sheamus. Everyone is eliminated and the last three are Ryback, Ziggler, and Rusev, the three favorites. (Come on, who here really wants Sheamus to win?) Rusev is eliminated in a way that leaves him looking strong and its down to Ziggler and Ryback. Ryback wins by countering a superkick from Ziggler to Ryback who's in the corner with a Meathook Clothesline, and follows it up with a ShellShock for the win. I feel Ryback should win because he's never won a title in his career yet, and he is worthy of the IC Title. I love Ziggler, but he's already awesome and he's already been IC Champ and doesn't need it to be good. Finally, Ryback Rules.\n\nNext is the Tag Title Chamber match. Before the match we go to the back with Renee Young for an interview with a team no one cares about, like Los Matedores, and they get attacked mid-interview by Harper and Rowan and they are injured so they are put into the chamber match last minute instead so that they actually can establish themselves as a good team, because Los Matedores won't prove anything, The match starts and the teams come out and Cesaro and Tyson Kidd and the Acension start off. Out 3rd from the pod is PTP, Fourth is Lucha Dragons, Fifth is Harper and Rowan, and Sixth are the champs, Kofi and Big E. The Last 4 teams are Lucha Dragons, New Day, Cesaro and Kidd and Harper and Rowan. Of course there has to be a spot where one guy jumps on all the teams when they are standing near each other from the top of the pod and they all fall down. That spot always happens in these kinds of matches and they are funny to watch. Lucha Dragons are eliminated, New Day is eliminated, guaranteeing new tag champs,  last two teams are Harpy and Rowy, and Cesay and Tysony and Harper and Rowan defeat them to become new tag champs. Harper and Rowan are both great, and they would make great tag champs.\n\nNext up would be Neville vs Bo Dallas, and Dallas enters first than Neville, and they have a good match up until Bo gets Neville in trouble with the ref and is distracted and Bo gives Neville  a low blow for the rollup and the win. I know people think im stupid and that Neville should win, but Bo hasn't been on for awhile and he needs a win and maybe they can pick him up where he left off and they can feud for a while longer and Neville can come out of the feud ultimately victorious.\n\nNext up would be the Three Way Divas Title Match, and Naomi would win. Paige is already a 2 time champ, and she is at the top, and Nikki is pretty boring IMO and has been champ for long enough, so I feel Naomi deserves the title because she hasn't done much.\n\nFinally, the big fight is here. It's time for Kevin Owens vs John Cena. Get ready, because this is where the \"big angle\" starts, and it spills into the main event.\n\nOwens comes out with a shirt mocking Cena that was trending on Twitter lately, where it says the champ is here with Canadian colors (Owens is Canadian), and it has the arrow pointing to the title, but instead of it being a picture of the US Title, its a picture of the NXT Title. Cena would come out with an Owens shirt, mocking Kevin. This is literally the most excited I've been for a Cena match since he faced Bryan at Summerslam 2013, and it will be a great match. Near the end of the match Cena grapples Owens into the corner and goes for his comeback. Cena calls for the Five Knuckle Shuffle and runs the ropes when suddenly Owens powers up and grounds Cena with a Popup Powerbomb for the win. Owens NEEDS TO WIN, because it would make no sense whatsoever for a guy like Cena to beat Owens in his main roster debut match. Owens needs to look strong and beating Cena clean is the perfect way to do it.\n\nAfter the match, Owens is walking up the ramp when the Authority comes out and starts clapping. Owens smiles and walks next to the Authority. Owens is now part of the Authority. After that, already I care more about the Authority. But the \"big angle\" doesn't end there. It's main event time.\n\nBefore that though, we go up to the \"Analyst Panel\" or whatever its called, the panel on the pre show, and they discuss the show so far and make their predictions for the main event.\n\nSuddenly, we go to HHH backstage and he announces breaking news: the WWE World Title match is now a No DQ Match.\n\nA video package is shown for the match and out comes Ambrose than Rollins. Ambrose doesn't wait and comes and attacks Rollins mid-entrance and the match starts. After the match goes on for about 10 minutes, they go backstage and obviously since they are in Corpus Christi, they have to do an angle with the Gulf of Mexico. Ambrose and Rollins fight backstage and it spills outside and Ambrose throws the title into the Gulf and Rollins panics and jumps in after it and Ambrose follows and they fight in the water. Rollins grabs it and Ambrose and Rollins fight back to the ring, The fight goes on for another 5 minutes and Ambrose is about to win when suddenly the Authority enters and they come out with new Authority member Kevin Owens. They check on Rollins and they all get ready to attack Ambrose when suddenly Roman Reigns comes out for the assist. Roman grabs two steel chairs and tosses one to Ambrose. The Authority enters the ring and they get ready to fight when suddenly Reigns hits Ambrose with the chair and turns heel. This would be such a good oppurtunity, as it would get every fan more invested in Reigns and the smart fans who hate Roman would finally start to invest their interest in Roman if he is used right as a heel. I dislike Reigns myself, and him turning heel would allow me to like him so much more. \n\nReigns laughs and shakes hands with HHH and crew. The Authority enters and attacks a downed Dean Ambrose.  Rollins  goes for a Pedigree and pins him to retain the title. \n\nThis would allow everyone to become so much more interesting in the Authority. No one likes Kane, or HHH, or Big Show, I like Rollins and J and J, they are the only good part. But with Owens and Reigns now in the Authority, it would allow them to finally do something more with the Authority and make it even more dominant so that they aren't  just having boring 29052305858 minute promos every Monday. I would actually want to see more of the Authority now with Rollins, Owens and now a hopefully well-booked Heel Reigns in there. \n\nElimination Chamber would go off the air with the Authority and the new members Reigns and Owens standing tall over Ambrose.\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg"}, {"score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/38079c/serious_how_would_the_golden_gate_bridge_look_if/", "id": "t3_38079c", "author": "FenixSword", "title": "[Serious] How would the Golden Gate Bridge look if the main cables were severed?", "timecreated": 1433108940.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "After seeing Godzilla last year and San Andreas today, I was got into an argument with my friends. \n\nIn the movie Godzilla, after he crashes through the bridge, the street holds itself up and there is only a hole where he walked through.

Many players quitting out of frustration after repeatedly loosing at 4 wins or less. An increase in evenly matched high skill teams leading to less decisive progression. Map fatigue. Active cheating and attempts to bypass the loss system by any means necessary. \n\nThe net result of this seems inevitable, even if the cheating and dropping is dealt with. Over the coming weeks ToO will see a steady and strong decline in players and the uniformity of high skill players remaining will mean fewer and fewer trips to the lighthouse. Eventually, many of those skilled teams will also see less of the 5+ wins because of this, stop earning meaningful rewards, and move on to something else. Trials seems to be a fated victim of its own design.\n\nThe question is, what can be done to keep Trials fresh, and keep people coming back? Map rotation isn't enough, especially with the hatred for many of the current options. Modifications to the gametype? Changes in the reward system? Other means of access and/or different reasons to visit the lighthouse?\n\n\nI don't have many ideas but I'm interested in hearing others. A couple I've considered:\n\n* **Etheric light rewards after a certain number of wins, regardless of passages and losses in between.** For example if you manage 10 wins over the course of one weekend, you gain one Etheric light. That way your time invested is still worth it even if you are evenly matched, and there is still motivation to fight hard and win as much as possible. Would also encourage repeat passages so people don't give up after one set, win or lose.\n* **Armor which is purchasable with Passage Coins.** Nothing cheap mind you, say 25 coins or more, but something to reward competition and add value to those low level packages. May need to reduce the drop rate of coins from normal Crucible to incentivize Trials play though.\n\nAnd to reduce the motivation for cheating and dropping behavior:\n\n* **Adjust PoE level 35 rewards to at least be somewhat on par with Trials of Osiris gear.** Possibly add a top tier PoE reward which grants access to the Lighthouse, but with different rewards. Most of the PoE equipment we have seen so far isn't on par with ascended Vault of Glass or Crota's End gear, and frequently even worse than vendor gear (?!), leaving light and exotic bounties as the only real drive behind PoE, while Trials is the pinnacle of legendary HoW gear (not to mention the fame-factor). Make the Trials appealing because it is a good path for PvP enthusiasts, not because it's seen as the only means to gain the best endgame gear and social area.\n\nFor full disclosure, I'm not great at PvP and I know it. I've made 8 wins the last two weeks due to friends who are better than I am, helpful, kind, and enjoy good teamwork, not by my own not-so-elite skills. Among my clan we've tried some passages with other mixes of players that were complete failures because the opponent skill level has jumped so quickly. Frankly I don't expect to see the lighthouse, ever, unless it is opened for other purposes. But that doesn't change that I think Trials is a fun experience, with a gametype I've enjoyed far more than I expected to, and I feel like it should be worth playing for a wide mix of skill levels, even if they don't do that well or get the best rewards. \n\nIt would also be a huge shame to see so much development that was put into Trials and the lighthouse go to waste because of player fatigue.\n\nSo, thoughts?\n\n--------\n\nEdit: I just wanted to say thank you to those who are contributing thoughtful responses and understand the discussion. I've said it a few times, but this has *nothing* to do with pulling the best ToO rewards down from the elite or belittling the accomplishment. It's about keeping people playing and trying, so the competitive aspect of Trials doesn't die off - which is exactly what will let the elite to keep doing what they do best and get rewarded for it. :)", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w"}, {"score": 283, "url": "http://gfycat.com/PersonalHeartfeltGoldenmantledgroundsquirrel", "id": "t3_3807r0", "author": "monsterpartyhat", "title": "Besiege Space Program, Mark I", "timecreated": 1433109155.0, "subreddit": "Besiege", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_35zhe"}, {"score": 19, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/37x1ky/i_know_im_early_in_bleach_but_holy_shit/", "id": "t3_37x1ky", "author": "ShwimmingAway", "title": "I know I'm early in Bleach but holy shit", "timecreated": 1433040694.0, "subreddit": "bleach", "selftext": "I just watched episode 17 and I think my level of excitement/tenseness was in the top 3 from watching a fight (One Piece's Luffy v Rob Lucci/Kuma are the other two fights).

One year ago our first child was born. Since that time, or even before the labor, things started getting worse (exponentially over the time, if I can say so). To cut a long story short, my wife is extremely unhappy with me. Everyone besides me is better - other husbands, her ex boyfriends, my dad, her dad, etc... I'm the worst. \n\nThe problem is that I feel that she is very unfair. I don't think that I'm so bad as she claims. She really hates that I cycle or do some other sports two times a week, instead of spending that time with her and our baby. But besides these two times a week I spend rest of the time with them (I don't meet with friends on my own, don't drink, don't play computer games, etc.). I think that it is normal and even healthy that I should do some sport from time to time and in a normal relationship, even with a small baby it shouldn't be a problem, especially when I have a job when I have to sit for 8 hours a day. She doesn't work (but she used to before the baby), so maybe she doesn't understand that sometimes I'm also tired and need some time off. Also she doesn't like when I refuse to do something what she asks me to do. But it happens really very, very rarely (a few times during last year). Normally I'm helping her - spending time with baby, vacuuming, taking dishes out of dishwasher, paying bills, etc. \n\nOf course I'm not perfect, but I feel that she expects me to be her slave, who does only what she wants and who has no rights. In case of all other people she only sees their advantages, while in my case she sees only my disadvantages. We had a lot of fights, when I heard a lot of bad things about myself. I'm trying to be as calm down as I can, and I was trying to prove that I wasn't as bad as she claimed (maybe I shouldn't have done it?) but it costs me a lot. \n\nOur bedroom have been dead for over a year too. Currently, we don't live together anymore, she wanted me to move out of our apartment. Her family is helping her. My only hope that all of this is because of some hormones, she is breastfeeding, but honestly I'm very tired with this situation, and I'm not sure if I want to go back to her (if she changes her mind!). But overall I feel very bad with this situation, especially because of our baby, it is the worst thing which has happened in my life.\n\nI wonder if any of you were in such situation and if there is any chance that all of it is an effect of pregnancy, labor and breastfeeding? Can I expect that she will be better? Or maybe she is just like this, and these negative traits appeared with such power after the baby, because before we had super simple life, without any problems and struggles?\n\nTLDR: My wife is very unhappy with me, she claims I'm the worst, and everyone is better than me. I find it very unjust, because besides work, and some sport activities I spend all time with her and our baby. She wanted me to move out. My only hope is that her behavior is an effect of pregnancy and breatfeeding.

Venting imminent. It's one of *those* posts. \n\nI've been on T for 4 months exactly now. I've tried to stay realistic, tried to be patient... but yeah, that patience has run out. I'm out at work and to my friends and family, but while everyone sans strangers calls me Jake I sure as hell don't pass. I have some hurdles in the way of me passing-- I'm still underweight after a decade of Anorexia (so finding clothes that fit is stupidly difficult), I'm an emotive and effeminate (and very gay) person in general, and my voice has barely changed a goddamn bit. I know voice can take over a year to hit the male range, but from all these timelines and accounts I see it's supposed to drop within the first three months. I'm damn sure it's the biggest obstacle in the way of me passing-- strangers switch to \"she's\" once I open my mouth. \n\nI know passing isn't everything. I'll still take presenting as \"a butch lesbian who doesn't give two shits about her budding stache\" over \"just some tomboy girl\" any day. But still hearing my girl voice day in and day out has finally gotten super dysphoric for me. I try to talk deeper, but at work I always end up reverting to a girly-ass \"retail voice\" that squeaks every time I call out drinks (I'm a barista). My coworkers struggle to call me \"he\"... and feel like I can't really blame them. I often even *feel bad* when they call me \"he\"-- like they're doing it out of pity with skepticism.\n\nAs a medical disclaimer, my T levels *are* well within the male range as of mid-April, and my dosage has increased since then. Right now all I've seen is a budding teen boy stache, slight build changes (mostly in the shoulders, but I can't really tell what's the T and what's the result of free weights), a very light dusting of backne, and modest growth in the downstairs. My voice is *a tad* lower, but still girly as hell even when I talk deeply. Emotionally I still swing between passionate/emotional and depressed, though I don't cry anymore. I'm still way too self conscious to post pictures.\n\n\nAnyway, I guess I'm looking for other guys with similar issues to come out of the woodwork and maybe share their woes so I can know that this is normal. That I just happen to read about all the guys with quick transitions because they talk about them more, I guess. Or maybe something is actually going wrong-- I don't know.

As we are headed out a group passes us. The group consists of two 22-25 year old girls and three guys the same age. Its clear to me , based upon how the group interacts, everyone is just friends. As they pass , I look at them - guys make eye contact and say hi. Both girls avoid eye contact and act aloof as they walk by. Ones a 7 the other 7.5. The 7.5 turned me on. An hour or so passes as my wife and I hike.  We then pass the group again and keep hiking. After about 20 minutes, my wife and I stop and are just chilling out enjoying the view and resting ( we are above tree line at this point) , suddenly the girl who is  a 7.5 and one of her orbitter friends come hiking along . Instead of passing she just stops right next to me and my wife. She then just begins hanging out. First her ass is towards me and then she turns to the side and is looking at me. So, I start up a conversation and shoot the breeze with them for awhile. Meanwhile my wife just sits there and listens. Eventually we ( my wife and I ) say our goodbyes and take off. At the top of the mountain were chilling and soon 7.5 arrives walks by and pretty much eye fucks me. I smirk and she goes and hangs out with her group. An hour later,  my wife and I are hiking along , Im ahead and going along at a brisk pace. She then says to me sarcastically \" in a rush to catch up with your new  group\"  I AA by responding with \" Damn straight - Im now accepting memberships.\" She's silent for a minute or two then says\" Im done hiking with you\" I laugh and we go along she then says\"  You've always said its an abundant world - well two can play the game\" I laughed again  and she responds with \" Keep it up too long and Ill leave you\"  I said nothing whereupon she says \" go enjoy your new group of friends\" I AA with \" well one of the prerequisites is that if you want to be a female member - you need to suck a mean cock\" She responds with \" Maybe you could have a threesome\" I remained silent and we then hiked alone for the remainder of the day. The hamster has calmed down a bit and she's generally pleasant this evening.\nI need advice: how do you respond to a wife who acts like this.

His only comment was \"I prefer when you're skinny.\"\n\nI'm pretty damn insulted like first, it's not even like I blew up at all. The baby bump is hardly massive (looks like I had a big lunch) and like why even say that when I'm getting bigger GROWING OUR CHILD? Like obviously I can't help it and I'm only going to get bigger from here on out.\n\nI guess combined with the distance and feeling like there's a lack of support on his end, I'm extra sensitive.

I'm feeling insulted by his comment, is it worth mentioning?\n\n**********EDIT***********\nThanks for the responses guys. This was all over text message with him because he was working so I sent him a message saying \"It's very hard to read your tone through text. What do you mean you prefer that I'm thin? I'm trying not to be offended and give you the benefit of the doubt that you were joking but I feel very bad about that comment.\" \n\nHis response: I'm just saying you were sexy before and you'll be back to that body when another person isn't in your stomach.\n\nNo apology given and I just left it at that for now. We will be talking later on tonight so hope that goes well.\n\nAnyway, it made me think there is a bigger underlying issue here, one being that I'm too fearful to even confront my husband about a hurtful comment because he usually gets very defensive when I call him out. I can already hear what he will say if I bring it up to him again tonight. Probably something along the lines of me being selfish and ridiculous about needing reassurance about our relationship. Or something about how I need \"validation\" from him and how I'm insecure and so on, so forth. \n\nThanks for all the advice and for making a pregnant woman feel less insane for being so hurt over a comment like that!", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn"}, {"score": 487, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/3DEBaz5.png", "id": "t3_37y1pr", "author": "treelovinhippie", "title": "So um, why is TPG storing my password in plaintext?

Lots of them. And a pretty damn cool guy certified to fly them. Now, every time he gets a new toy, everybody stops work to come see him fly it. These drones range from a simple 4-propellar setup with a gopro underneath to large, expensive behemoths with GPS, image tracking, and 360 cameras. (And they all have nicknames, of course.)\n\nHis latest aquisition was one of the latter - super expensive, super sleek, and capable of flying up to insane heights. We all ooh-ed and ahh-ed as he made it circle above our heads and track our movements as we ran ahead of it. However, when we were heading back in, Drone Pilot (DP) pulled me aside.\n\n>DP: EmpressHaruhi, you live at <address>, yeah? Just up the hill?\n\n>Me: Uh, yeah? Why, planning to break in?\n\n>DP: Nope, but I need your help with something. When you go home for lunch, put on your <Company> shirt and go onto your balcony, okay?\n\n>Me: Alright, but if what you're doing turns out to be illegal, I'm blaming you for everything.\n\nTwo imporant things to note, here - I lived a very short walk away from the company, in a tall apartment building, and our comapny shirts were bright orange. So, when I returned home on my lunch break, I put on my shirt, and went to stand on the balcony as requested. After five minutes of staring at the building across from mine, trying to determine if the lady on the seventh floor really had painted her walls that shade of magenta, I was startled by a loud whirring, and looked down almost in time to get smacked in the face by DP's newest drone.\n\n>Me: What the hell?!\n\nA beep from my phone signaled a text from DP.\n\n>DP: (via text) Walk from one end of the balcony to the other!\n\nAs I did so, the drone continued to hover just beyond the railing, tracking the bright orange of my company shirt.\n\n>DP: (via text) Now go onto the roof!\n\nI ducked back inside, and climed the stairs to our buildings roof, a good 15 stories above the ground. As I emerged, I was once again greeted by the whirring of the drone, bouncing through the air before me like an excited (and noisy) white puppy.\n\n>DP: (via text) Now run around again! I want to see what range I can get! Lets see if we can draw a snowman with the GPS!\n\nFor the rest of the afternoon, I got to run around my building's roof and parking lot, making patterns, chasing the drone, and generally having a fantastically good time \"testing\" the new drone with DP. Upon returning, exausted, to my apartment, I was startled by a whirr-tap-tap on my balcony window, and opened it to find the drone, hovering before me, with a note taped to it's front:\n\n>My new nickname is <my real first name>! Thank you for playing with me today!\n\n**TL;DR: Techo puppy wants to play!**\n\n___________\n\n**Edit: For those wondering about battery life, yes, we did take breaks to swap out and charge batteries, it wasn't one continual flight.**", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sfg5"}, {"score": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblemcasual/comments/3801d2/announcement_animemanga_discussion_thread_may_31th/", "id": "t3_3801d2", "author": "DeafHawaiian", "title": "[Announcement] Anime/Manga Discussion Thread May 31th", "timecreated": 1433106454.0, "subreddit": "fireemblemcasual", "selftext": "Comment in this thread about anime or manga you may have watched or read recently!

There are still a few that remain unplayed, but overall it was a good experience. I found some new heroes I like a lot, and others I definitely won't play again. Here's how it all went down:\n\nSlark - 10/1/12. Win. I discovered the power of Slark. Became a menace and picked off people when I could, particularly CM. Will play him again.\n\nSpirit Breaker - 12/7/18. Win. Our Bloodseeker carried pretty hard, our first-time Invoker was actually pretty good, and I found it found charging people and setting up kills. Will play him again.\n\nFaceless Void - 2/2/5. Loss. I started off OK, but their Huskar got fed early, and with Ursa and KOTL they pushed us in quickly. Didn't really dig FV.\n\nPhantom Assassin - 13/5/14. Loss. This game was an hour and 11 minutes, very intense. We found it hard to kill their Gyro before he killed us. I did my best to focus him first but ultimately we fell short in too many teamfights. \n\nRiki - 6/1/9. Win. I helped secure first blood in mid lane and started to roll from there. Our Warlock was an absolute pro Warlock (at least as pro as you can be at my level) and he truly carried us to a win in this game.\n\nAnti Mage - 11/3/15. Win. Their Legion got fed early and we found it hard to kill her. This game was very back and forth but once I got a few items I was a menace in teamfights. We managed to turn it at the very end. A nice comeback.\n\nWinter Wyvern - 6/4/16. Loss. I really enjoyed playing Winter Wyvern. I thought we had a chance in this one but unfortunately our Shadow Fiend was never able to overcome a poor start, despite his best efforts, and we just didn't have enough damage in teamfights.\n\nLegion Command - 8/8/12. Loss. I enjoyed Legion but Axe countered me in lane. And if he's not a counter to Legion, then he just outplayed me. Their Morphling became unkillable late game and we didn't stand a chance at that point.\n\nBatrider - 4/4/12. Loss. I tried my best to be an annoying initiator. Unfortunately I found it hard to farm a blink dagger and ended up buying other items. Their Void went 17/1/3 so you can probably imagine how that went for us. I won't be playing Batrider again. \n\nUrsa - 7/1/8. Win. Strangely enough I had never played Ursa. Not sure why, I really enjoyed Ursa. With Lina and Veno we were extremely good at pushing and won this one quickly. \n\nBeastmaster - 7/3/11. Loss. Our Earth Spirit and Alchemist combined to go 6-23 and it was hard to overcome that. I surprisingly enjoyed playing Beastmaster, though I'm still not sure where exactly he fits. \n\nSven - 2/5/7. Loss. Enemy Pudge and Silencer both got super fed early and we got steamrolled after that. I think Sven would be fun in the right lineup, but still not sure how much I'll play him.\n\nBloodseeker - 8/0/9. Win. Yup, I had never played Bloodseeker, either. I did pretty well, and enjoyed him. I'll definitely play him again. Note - our Slardar went 25/1/5 and looked like somebody playing on a smurf. He abused the enemy team.\n\nTerrorblade - 1/6/2. Loss. I went to safe lane but nobody came with me, Windranger made my life miserable and I fumbled all over Terrorblade's abilities. Won't be playing him again.\n\nTiny - 3/6/11. Loss. I was able to see the power of Tiny with Aghs and a level 3 ultimate as I was doing some good damage at the end. However, I had a poor start, and the enemy Ursa went 21-5 en route to absolutely crushing us. \n\nBroodmother - 0/0/0. Loss. Got countered hard by Kunkka, and I wasn't feeling Broodmother at all. Our Tusk abandoned very early so I left shortly after. Won't ever play Broodmother again.\n\nTemplar Assassin - 6/3/6. Loss. I won mid without much trouble and got good items, but I found it hard to secure kills as TA. This was a frustrating game because my team was in control the entire game, then we lost one teamfight and they were able to push for the win.\n\nElder Titan - 8/4/12. Loss. I really enjoyed Elder Titan. Stomp is awesome, and his ult hits hard. I'll be playing him again, though I'm not sure which role/lane is the best for him. We lost to a decent Slark, and too many things on the screen with enemy Naga and Meepo.\n\nBounty Hunter - 8/4/14. Win. Our Sniper and Nightstalker carried us in this game, but I had some good pick-offs as Bounty Hunter. I just wanted to be as annoying as possible. I think I'll try him out again.\n\nLifestealer - 1/5/1. Loss. Didn't enjoy Lifestealer at all. Our Mirana intentionally fed to 0-7 and then abandoned, and our Troll was 7-21. A pretty terrible match all around.\n\nMedusa - 6/0/14. Win. Holy crap she is slow to come online but when she does, she's near unstoppable. Our Troll also overcame a crappy start to finish 22-10. Not sure how much I'll play Medusa again, but she's interesting.\n\nLycan - 6/3/9. Loss. His farming ability is insane, as is his mobility. Still, didn't really feel like my type of hero. Enemy Tusk got super fed and we couldn't stop him.\n\nShadow Fiend - 13/7/10. Loss. Once I figured out how to use his abilities, I really liked Shadow Fiend. I'm definitely going to play as him again. In this game, I was unfortunately the only one on the team to bring any damage to the table. Storm Spirit was starved for items and our Alch went 0-10. Their CM got 17 kills.\n\nPhantom Lancer - 24/7/17. Loss. I set a personal record for most kills with this game. This game also lasted one hour, 22 minutes, which is the second-longest game I've ever been in. Their Meepo went 24/15/14 and we literally could not kill him at the end. Despite my best efforts I could not carry us to a win in this game.\n\nWeaver - 9/4/15. Loss. I did pretty well in this game, and our Sniper got fed. However, our Morphling and Meepo combined to go 2-31. I can see myself playing Weaver again (and eventually did, too!)\n\nQueen of Pain - 10/1/5. Win. I was matched with Juggernaut mid and had little trouble winning the lane. I loved how much damage QOP can put out, but holy crap does she use up mana quickly. I would like to play QOP again, but she's not at the top of my list of mids.\n\nOverall I felt it was a good experience even though I lost a lot of these games. Heroes I still have yet to play: Chen, Earth Spirit, Meepo, Spectre, Techies, and Tinker. Invoker, Storm Spirit and Natures Prophet are on my list of unplayed heroes, however, I have played them in bot games before.\n\nSome new heroes I'm going to play more: Shadow Fiend, Beastmaster, Spirit Breaker, Bloodseeker, Elder Titan. With Beastmaster and Elder Titan, I still don't really know where they fit as far as roles/lanes but I do know I will play as them again.

First, some background:\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was so bad at sports that my classmates hated me for making them lose and eventually they just pretended I wasn't there when picking teams.

[Here is the Press Kit](http://www.teslamotors.com/presskit/teslaenergy) and [here is the order page with details](http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall). Tesla has partnered with and/or gotten endorsements from the following public companies: SolarCity ($SCTY), SolarEdge ($SEDG), Amazon ($AMZN), Target ($TGT), EnerNoc ($ENOC), and AES ($AES). How will these stocks react and how should they react?\n\nBy the way, the battery they announced is incredibly cheap: $3500 for 10 kWh, and $3000 for 7 kWh. This is a price of $350/kWh and $429/kWh respectively. This is incredibly cheap compared to Tesla's competitors.

No doubt our reports from my fellow blogger, Expat Ernie, have made this more obvious to our regular readers, but I\u2019m here to talk about something more innocent. One of the simple pleasures of living in here in the Land of Smiles is the cheap, ubiquitous availability of massage parlors. After a long day of walking around Bangkok, there\u2019s nothing so revitalizing as a good massage.\n\nAs this is our first post on the massage offerings here in Thailand, we\u2019re going to give you a few tips to get you started. I know it can be a daunting task to walk into a massage parlor, especially considering the options on offer here in Bangkok. This fine city offers a variety of massages, and discerning customers want to know what they\u2019re getting before they commit. I understand. So with that in mind, let\u2019s talk about the basics.\n\nMassage Parlors: Normal or Happy?\n\nWithout even asking, I know the first question on your mind. You want to know how to distinguish between a normal massage parlor and a happy-ending shop. Well, truth be told, it can sometimes be difficult to know. But if you take a few bits of advice to heart, you can generally make the right call.\n\nIf you pass a massage parlor with girls sitting outside, thrusting menus in front of your face, it\u2019s a good bet that you\u2019ve found a happy-ending shop. Employees at a normal massage parlor are paid an hourly wage, plus whatever tips they can make from customers. If the employees sitting outside the shop are trying to get you inside, it\u2019s because they can earn money on your happy ending. There are exceptions to this rule, but this is a good starter.\n\nIf the staff sitting outside the massage parlor includes ladyboys, you\u2019re probably looking at a happy-ending shop. There\u2019s nothing wrong with getting a massage from a man or a woman, straight or gay, but most normal massage parlors do not employ ladyboys. Why? The sad but honest truth is that ladyboys tend to scare tourists.\n\nAnother expat friend of mine swears that he always knows by looking at what the staff is wearing. If they\u2019re wearing skirts, sarongs, or other clothing that comes off quickly and easily, then it just might be a happy-ending shop. I\u2019m not so sure about this rule, but I can say that most of the normal massage parlors I\u2019ve been to have a dress code that often includes utilitarian, rather than sexy, uniforms. My buddy may be right, so keep this in mind, but this is not a hard and fast rule.\n\nIf you find a spot in a part of town without any obvious nightlife influence, then you\u2019ve probably encountered a normal massage parlor. If the prices are posted somewhere out front, that\u2019s another sign that you\u2019re looking at a normal place. If the employees seem uninterested in whether you get a massage or not, that\u2019s probably another good sign that you\u2019re in a normal massage parlor. The key here is to understand the context of your surroundings. Are you near Nana Plaza or closer to Ekkamai Soi 30?\n\nTypes of Massage\n\nOk, so you\u2019ve found your massage parlor and you want a bit of relaxation. What\u2019s next? Most massage parlors offer a variety of massages, but the most popular are foot massage, Thai massage, and oil massage.\n\nA foot massage is one of the more invigorating ways to spend an hour. The traditions of foot reflexology date back centuries, and I never bought into this bullshit until I started getting foot massages. The name, foot massage, is deceptive, because it\u2019s really about more than your feet. You are most often seated in a recliner, tilted back so that you can close your eyes and relax under their delicate hands. They start with your feet and toes, but also spend significant time on your ankles and calves, up to the knees. Doing both legs this way lasts about 40 minutes, if you\u2019re getting a one-hour massage. The balance of time is spent on your arms and shoulders, then after you get up from the chair and sit on the footstool, your back, neck and head. In most Bangkok massage parlors, a one-hour version of this massage will run you about 150-400 baht, but you\u2019re probably getting ripped off if you pay more than 300. The best shops will give you a discount on the second hour, so you should consider taking the time and enjoying the treatment.\n\nA Thai massage can be an amazing experience, and I often prefer a two-hour version of this one. This is all about twisting, deep stretching, and rhythmic massage, ideal for releasing tension and making you feel revitalized. This is a full-body massage where you lie down face first for the first half, then flip onto your back for the second half. This also usually involves you changing out of your clothes (keep your underwear on, guys), and slipping into the light shirt and pants they provide. The small shirts never seem to fit me, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem that I just wear the pants and go without a shirt. Similar to foot massages, most massage parlors charge between 150-400 baht for a one-hour Thai massage, with discounts for the second hour. This is a great massage for a two-hour hole in your day, but beware that this may also lead to your falling asleep. This has happened to me more times than I can count. Fortunately for me, the sound of my snoring wakes me up almost immediately.\n\nYou can\u2019t avoid getting naked for an oil massage. Luckily, they\u2019ll give you a towel to cover your bits, so it\u2019s not a problem unless you\u2019re overly shy. This massage is about using the oil to improve circulation, relax your muscles, and relieve muscle pain. Some massage parlors also swear that it can reduce cellulite, but I\u2019m not so sure about the science on this one. Usually, you shower before and after an oil massage, but as with a Thai massage, this is a full-body treatment where you lie down face first for the first half, then flip onto your back for the second half. The oil massage is usually a bit more expensive than the other options, often running between 300-600 baht, with discounts for the second hour if that\u2019s your thing.\n\nMost massage parlors offer additional massages focusing on deep tissue, your neck and back, or other parts of the body. If you\u2019re interested to know more, check out the menu of offerings at your local massage parlor of choice. Also note that you can always ask specifically for a man or woman to perform your massage, if you\u2019re more comfortable one way or the other.\n\nTipping in Massage Parlors\n\nIn most places around Thailand, tipping is not necessary, but you should really tip at the massage parlor. Even a tip as small as 20 baht or 50 baht is good, although I generally give them a 100-baht note before I leave. It\u2019s also a good idea to make a mental image of your masseuse before your massage is over, because you don\u2019t want to tip the wrong person! Usually, this is not a problem, as it\u2019s customary for them to meet you at the door and wish you a good day as you leave, and this is the perfect time to tip them. They work really hard, and that extra 100 baht is enough to buy a full dinner of street food. Don\u2019t be a Cheap Charlie: tip well if the service was good.\n\n<Excerpted from http://TheFarang.net, a blog about expat life in Bangkok, Thailand>", "subreddit_id": "t5_340kd"}, {"score": 40, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapWar/comments/34gpbb/flippin_hell_orangered_well_fing_done_lads/", "id": "t3_34gpbb", "author": "changingpete", "title": "Flippin' hell, OrangeRed!

I gave it a shot... and I crashed and burned.\n\nSee my confidence has been getting too high recently. Success has been plentiful and almost at will. I have been feeling supreme, invulnerable, indomitable, indefatigable; king and poet, both bard and lord. Well, that shit is fucking over. Holy shitballs.\n\nOh, and by-the-way, the nightmare scenario quickly got more nightmarier. (I know the word is nightmarish, but I don't give a shit, I like my word.) It turns out that in her youth she was a showgirl for a luxury consumer brand, where she would go and get rich men to come look at the expensive shit that was renting her ass out. Ah, fuck. I can only imagine the A-level fuckers she used to fuck. Alpha widow? She's a whole fucking Alpha mauso-god-damned-leum.\n\nThis bitch gave me shit tests that had to be measured not in number, but as a ROF -- rate-of-fire. And let me just say, she was giving an M-60 machine gun a run for its money. They just did. not. stop.... ever.\n\nEventually I just shut up, because amused mastery is tiring when you are doing *nothing* else. It was like a really boring and annoying yet somehow deadly hailstorm; I keep saying it, but it's true... it just never stopped. I don't know why I didn't end it after the annoying dinner, but fuck-only-knows-why I went for round two with this harpy via frozen yogurt. I think that I was like a trauma victim by that point, where you just go along with anything, like it's happening to someone else. God knows I wished I were somewhere else by the end.\n\nFinally she started talking shit about gay guys. Fuck that. You can't say gay guys are the problem because you don't know what to say to your kids. Louis CK has a bit about that, but she literally fucking said it, that she doesn't know what to say to her son. If you want to be a bigot because dicks in butts freaks you out, fine, own it... but don't hide your ignorance behind your child. Then we started talking religion... ah, shit. \"You're not an atheist, are you?\" Ah, double shit. Why did I sign up for this? No frozen yogurt is worth this...\n\nAt the end I drove her back to her car and basically nope'd out. She wasn't feeling it by then either. Perhaps the part when I said, \"What's the difference between God and Santa Claus? God kills people.\" Maybe that was what lost it for me. I'm not that fussed, really.\n\nSo, why should you date women \"your own age\"? Because these entitled, self-absorbed, cynical, burnt-out-and-worn-out bitches will remind you what is wonderful in a woman -- because they have absolutely none of it. Joy? Joie de vivre? Fun? Innocence? Nope, nope, nope and are-you-fucking-kidding-me?\n\nSpend some time with high-30's-low-40's and you will see. You will be humbled. You will learn from the challenge and you will grow, but by god and by gum you will suffer in the meantime. (It won't work as well for you 20-somethings... they know that you are basically only for fucking, so they won't give you the same level of scrutiny. You'll have to wait until your mid-30's to get the full experience.)\n\nTL;DR - date burned-out husks of women in their late-30's-early-40's to learn what shit testing *really* is.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u"}, {"score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/comments/34htab/h_4_breakout_keys_w_4_chroma_keys/", "id": "t3_34htab", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "[H] 4 Breakout Keys [W] 4 Chroma keys", "timecreated": 1430464863.0, "subreddit": "GlobalOffensiveTrade", "selftext": "[removed]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y6r4"}, {"score": 2178, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/34h77r/im_15_is_it_weird_for_a_23_year_old_guy_to_be/", "id": "t3_34h77r", "author": "throwawaychicken123", "title": "I'm 15, is it weird for a 23 year old guy to be \"romantically interested\" in me?", "timecreated": 1430449382.0, "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "selftext": "Hi, basically what the title says.\n\n\nHe used to work where I worked and that's how we met.

Kinda thought he saw me as a little sister, tbh.\n\n\nBut he recently told me (through text) that I'm an \"amazing\" girl and I deserve the very best, that I'm so \"mature\" for my age, that I'm so \"beautiful\".

I want this thread to focus on the **positives** of the selection. I am sure you have watched his [highlight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZatnTkhT8Q) by now. If not check it out. Grabbing an elite talent at WR this year could be a smart move for a few reasons. Here are a couple that stand out to me.\n\n1. Dorsett is our solution at KR this year. He has elite speed and big play ability. We have been looking for someone with his skillset at KR for a long time. He can have a day 1 impact for the team at this position as he grows into an elite WR under tutelage of Andre Johnson and TY Hilton. \n\n2. Andrew Luck is going to break the bank. People are saying Dorsett is a Hilton clone. If that's the case Dorsett offers protection if we were to lose Hilton as a cap casualty. \n\nPersonally I think Dorsett looks like an elite WR based on the small sample size I have seen. Depending on how the rest of the draft shakes out this pick could end up making a lot more sense than it seems to make right now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r6es"}, {"score": 1155, "url": "http://gfycat.com/ConsciousSomberAngelfish", "id": "t3_34hrfm", "author": "ryzolandia", "title": "Nathan Arnold scored two cracking goals for Grimsby.", "timecreated": 1430463244.0, "subreddit": "soccer", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58"}, {"score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34hrbg/if_hitler_were_out_of_the_race_who_would_be_the/", "id": "t3_34hrbg", "author": "cysghost", "title": "If Hitler were out of the race, who would be the one person people would say is the super example of human evil?", "timecreated": 1430463121.0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "selftext": "As the title says.

I have decided that the anticipation has built to adequate levels :| \n\nOne while driving with my then girlfriend on our way out for the evening we found ourselves stopped at a quiet local intersection near a hospital.  There was one other car which was stopped opposite us.  I recognized the car across the intersection as a ubiquitous silver Honda Civic, especially as my wife had the same one.\n\nThe light changed and we proceded through the intersection.  The other car did not move however.  The realization that the other driver had stalled the car immediately entered my mind, though I had not been paying attention to it previously.  Uncharacteristically, I honked at the driver as I sped past in my red hatchback, mocking their poor driving skills (if a honk can be done in a mocking fashion).  My wife turned to me and asked \"Why did you do that?!?\" \nI just chuckled and said \"Because that guy stalled his car.\"  \nI don't know why I honked.  It isn't really something I would normally do.  I had no explanation for why I did it, for my wife or myself.\n\nHaving read Cohelo's The Alchemist, the idea of asking the universe for something had been planted.  Following my first glitch experience I \"asked\" the universe for another such experience to reinforce my understanding. \n\nSome time later I had borrowed my wife's car to run an errand one evening.  Predictably, I was sitting at the very same intersection (headed the other way) at a red light.  I should add that I have driven standard for 20 years.  In fact I have never owned a car that was not standard.  While that doesn't mean that I am impervious to stalling, it is rather rare.  However, on this evening I did stall the car as the light changed.  In a rather strange moment where I didn't seem to understand what had happened, I just sat there before restarting the car and carrying on.  No one was behind me.  \n\nPredictably, the only car around was a red hatchback that sped by and honked (mockingly) at me. \n\nAnd it was then that I recalled that I had been on the other side of this experience as well. \nTake from this what you will.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcwa"}, {"score": 34, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/36pfdy/update/", "id": "t3_36pfdy", "author": "[deleted]", "title": "Update", "timecreated": 1432173598.0, "subreddit": "AirForce", "selftext": "[deleted]", "subreddit_id": "t5_2roa2"}, {"score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/36pw5x/free_samples_from_flavour_crafters_evolve/", "id": "t3_36pw5x", "author": "zolofftt", "title": "Free samples from Flavour Crafter's EVOLVE collection (Montreal area only!)", "timecreated": 1432182101.0, "subreddit": "Canadian_ecigarette", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI've given out a few bottles of e-liquid already, but I still have a number of bottles of Flavour Crafter's new line that I'm looking to give away.

I feel weird as I have never posted any sort of \"transformation\" photo or story, but after making the decision to truly stay sober, and seeing how it changed my life, I would like to share. \n\n90 days ago I signed up for outpatient rehab. As an alcoholic, I was getting drunk every night, and doing heavy cocaine almost every other night which goes hand in hand with smoking a lot of cigarettes. It left my mother heart broken and my cousin, the most important person in my life next to my mother, to lose trust in me. After a night where I felt like I was going to overdose, I decided to cut the crap and make a change. \n\nI was depressed all the time and had low self esteem. One day, on a bike ride(doubting my sobriety, as I wanted an instant change) I saw a man jogging with a tshirt that read on the back \"The worst kind of disability to have is a bad attitude). I don't know what it was about that, but it made everything so clear to me. Just. Try. Harder. The only person that was stopping me from getting the things I want(family, love) and being the person I know I could be(someone that my friends and family trust and want to spend time with), was me. \n\nI took rehab seriously and really let the stories of others sink in, and humbly gave into the process. Today I am 90 days sober, my mother looks at me with the eyes that she once did when I was clean, and my cousin and I spend so much time together exercising and bonding laughing and all that awesome stuff.\n\nMost importantly, I am so happy. I have a positive outlook, even when things seem at their darkest. Because I am myself, my true self, I know that I can overcome. \n\nThis is me the day before I went to rehab, drunk and on cocaine:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/STaLo7A\n\n\nThis is me today:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/H0gPtzp\n\n\nThanks for listening everyone.

Kidlet does pretty well in the cart for most of a shopping excursion, until she decides she doesn't want to sit in the seat anymore. So, since I can't carry her while pushing the cart, I let her stand and hold her standing in the seat and sorta steer with my elbows. (All she wants is to rest her head on my shoulder, so I let her while I hold her steady and she usually kneels anyway) and when I have to grab something off the shelf, I just pick her up and bring her along.\n\nI've been doing this since she's been mobile (8 months, she's now 18 months) so we've got it down to a science. Just getting to the check out, where I tell her she has to sit and I buckle her in and she fusses, but I need 2 hands to get the cart unloaded so she just has to deal. Then I see it. The sanctimommy with her \"I'd like to speak to the manager/why is my special snowflake sitting on the bench\" haircut and laser - like glare on me. Do I give a fuck? Hell no, and I pay for my shit and hit the parking lot.\n\nWhile unloading my cart, SHE MAKES A STRAIGHT LINE FOR ME, to tell me it's not safe to let my baby stand in the cart and omg why aren't I using a cart cover don't I care more about my child? So I [look at her]( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb0yuwo8mZ1qlwj6r.gif ) and say, \"Did you seriously just follow me to my car in the parking lot to tell me how to raise my fucking kid? Do you want to reevaluate that decision before I go ahead and rip your ass to shreds and tell you to go fuck yourself?\"\n\nWell, you can guess she didn't care for that.

When there is an underlying tone during a conversation, someone is flirting with me, etc... I just plain *don't notice*.

And also a jerk too. \n\nHere's the story:\n\nI have had to take my 2012 Beetle to the VW dealership MANY times since March of this year because I had a roof panel replaced that later flew off while I was driving and various other problems/recalls. So after replacing this damn roof **three times** at two different dealerships, they finally got it right. They also left glue all over my car and damaged the right front fender. When I brought this to the service manager's attention I was told, \"That's not glue, that is tree sap!\", \"We did you a favor by replacing this for you for free.\" (it was under warranty), \"My guys would never damage a car then cover it up, they would come tell me\". I know that these managers' first line of defense is to deny deny deny. I get it. The only thing was, the entire time he was talking, he only addressed my fiance. I would say something and he wouldn't look at me. Then would answer me, but talked to my fiance. Do you really think a 6 foot hockey player would be caught driving a *Beetle*? And I know I look young, but I was not literally born yesterday. I am aware there is a difference between glue and tree sap! It seems every time I have picked up my car it is done to the lowest standard, but if my dad or fiance brings it in, it's done the right way the first time. Even more frustrating is when I know more about cars than these people who are treating me like I don't know my butt from a hole in the ground. \n\nThen to top it all off, the GM of the dealership calls **my dad** to apologize for how they treated **me**. I can't even get an apology.\n\nDoes this happen to anyone else??

First of all, I want to encourage anyone who has been assaulted to report. I initially wasn't, but am so grateful that I did (details below). Secondly, I'd love to get advice on what I'm going through--especially from people who have been through the same thing. Finally, it's therapeutic to just write things out... or so says my therapist. Names and locations have been changed. I broke this into sections because I know it's long.\n\nMy name is Annie and I am a 25-year-old girl. I was raped by one of my best friends of three years, Adam, on Cinco de Mayo. I was sober, he was not. I was walking him to his car from a bar, trying to convince him to call an Uber when suddenly I was pulled into his backseat, my dress was flipped up, and he stuck his penis into my vagina, anus, vagina, anus, over and over, regardless of how much I told him to cut it out, how much I squirmed, or how much I pushed him away. \n\n\n**The Immediate Aftermath**\n\n\nThe following morning I woke up in a haze. I had grabbed one of my friends (Michael) from the bar who lived nearby and crashed on his couch. The following morning, I woke up to Michael getting ready to go to work. He encouraged me to go get a kit. I paused. My anus was in so much pain... but would getting a kit mean reporting? Did I have it in me to turn over my friend to the police? Kits take hours don't they? And then I remembered: that day, that Wednesday, was the day of my performance review. Instead of getting the information that I desperately wish I had for this case, I went to work. \n\nWorking was miserable. I had only told Michael, who kept asking me what I needed to do. Get up. Get dressed. Drag yourself to work. Fill out paperwork. Write articles and pretend to care about PR campaigns and new clients. At about 3PM, I got a promotion to accompany my performance review. I felt ecstatic for about 15 minutes before my enthusiasm was drowned out by anxiety. What happened to me? I normally love my job. I. couldn't. focus. on. anything. \n\nUntil Mother's Day, that Sunday, I went from crying all the time to feeling numb. I quickly fell behind on my work. I slowly started telling others what happened. I told my best friend, my work best friend, and my boyfriend. In the back of my mind, I was reminding myself that I had been through this before. I was sexually assaulted in college and made the *mistake* of going to campus police. Nothing came of it until two other people came forward about being assaulted, he was expelled, and then was caught molesting a 14-year-old girl. He is in jail now.\n\nAs sad as it was, I learned two lessons from that experience. **Tell your parents early. Get therapy early.**\n\nSo as I tried to sit through Mother's Day brunch, I watched how happy my family was. I'm aware that telling others is burdensome--it's a reality few are willing to admit. They are going to worry, they are going to feel pain for me. I felt like I was about to rip apart my family. \n\nEven so, I decided to tell my parents over email the following day after a very important therapy session. **One thing that really helped was that I outlined what I didn't want them to do.**\n\n>Right now, I'm anxious about a number of things. \n>\n>1. That you'll think that because I'm out all the time, that it comes as less than a surprise.\n>2. That I flirt too much and asked for it.\n>3. That you won't believe me.\n>4. That you'll push me to prosecute (the truth is that I just want him out of my life, and an entire case sounds like the very worst process to go through). \n>5. That you'll ask me to describe what happened. I am not excited to share--and am having trouble with disassociating.\n\nBoth of my parents responded almost immediately. Because I was having trouble eating, my mother offered to come over the following Tuesday--just one week after the incident--and make me food. Luckily, by that point, I started to feel overwhelming rage. I decided to ask her to take me to the police station--just in case I decided to prosecute. Mom was thrilled to accompany me there.\n\n\n**Going to the police**\n\n\nWe drove together to the county police station at around 7PM. After waiting outside, a female police officer brought us out to a waiting area. She was... she was really the worst. She had me describe the rape in front of my mother, accused me of being drunk (as if that makes a difference?), and, after I told her that I had told Adam to \"cut it out,\" she said that it didn't sound like rape because I didn't outright say \"stop.\" \n\nI don't know in what other world \"cut it out\" means anything but \"stop.\" But that's neither here nor there.\n\nShe was joined by another officer--a male officer--who was far kinder. He brought me upstairs, closer to the detective who I'd eventually be working with, and pulled me away from others in the waiting area to collect the clothes that I hadn't brought myself to wash, photograph my scraped knees, bruised hip, and chaffed sides from where he had grabbed me, and had me retell him what had happened. He escorted me back to the waiting area where, in front of six other people in the waiting room, the female officer reappeared to chastise me for not reporting earlier. \n\nFinally, the detective emerged.\n\n\n**The Detective**\n\n\nMeeting with Detective Davidson was one of the most important moments in deciding to pursue a case. He took me to the back without my mother, where I wouldn't feel pressured to censor things for her. He started off by easy stuff--what do you do for a living, are you close with your family, etc. And then he had me describe the whole night in full detail. He asked me questions that revealed important things that I wouldn't have thought of--like how did I get out (pulling myself off of him and dumping myself out the side of the car), what time it happened (it must have happened between 9PM and 10PM because the event at the bar had just started), and I showed him texts that Adam had sent me, confessing a sense of guilt and dread and that he had driven home very drunk that night. \n\nDavidson was really the man who convinced me to go forward with charges. He said that I was in complete control of what happened--if I ever wanted to close the case, that would be my choice. He just wanted to get me to the point where, with evidence, a criminal case could be filed if I wanted to. \n\nThe very first thing that he had me do, after taking my statement and affirming that he thought it was rape as well, he had me get a kit. \n\n\n**The Rape Kit**\n\n\nGoogle where you can get a Physical Evidence Recovery Kit (PERK) if you need one. In my state, **it's paid for by taxpayers.** They didn't even take my insurance information. \n\nThe hospital near me has an entire department dedicated to PERK. Walking into the center was devastating. There was a young--maybe 16-year-old--girl with cuts all over her right arm and blood coming out of her nose. She was obviously assaulted that same day. She was cowering with her parents and couldn't choke out enough to even give the nurse her address. \n\nMy nurse's name was Claire. She was maybe in her mid-forties, kind, and gentle. She explained to me exactly what would happen. She would once again take pictures of my injuries, test me for STIs with both my urine and blood, and give me a physical exam. \n\nLittle did I know, my anus still had tears from the assault, even a week later. She spread a dye over my anus and vagina that highlighted the tears. As she manipulated my anus, a place that is now so sensitive both physically and emotionally, I started to cry. She waited patiently and spoke soothingly to me. I kept repeating, \"What's more embarrassing than getting raped in the ass?\" This would be the last time I would be capable of crying, even until today. She snapped photos of my genital injuries and let me go. The entire process took less than an hour. From this exam, we were able to learn that there were signs of forced entry and that he had given me chlamydia. \n\n\n**The Phone Sting**\n\n\nThe detective continued to work closely with me. I was able to identify Adam's address, turned over my credit card statement to prove I hadn't drank much that night, and felt *better* as time went on. The case gave me focus--I still tell myself, \"You, Adam, messed with the wrong bitch.\" \n\nIn our state, we're able to call someone and record them without them knowing. The sting kit is a machine that hooks into my phone and records a phone conversation.  After not talking to him for almost two weeks at this point, I was able to get him to talk to me for about ten minutes with the hook, \n\"Hey, you have chlamydia.\"\n\nUnfortunately, because this case hasn't gone to trial yet, I can't be any more specific than that on the sting, What I will say though is that Detective Davidson sat with me through it and wrote things down for me to say to Adam to try to get information out of him. We got a lot of what we wanted, but not everything. \n\n\n**What's next?**\n\n\nMy state is either going to bring him in for questioning or arrest him (without bail). I don't know the details, but my bet is that it will either be this week or next. This has all transpired over the course of less than a month. \n\nI wish that I could say I'm doing super well. The case, emotionally, has honestly been one of the best things for me. Instead of allowing my mind to wander about \"what ifs\" or stewing on the violence of the crime, I feel like this is something I can be proactive about. My negative energy is serving a purpose. \n\nWith that said, I've had some really bad days. I'm still looking for a trauma specialist--everyone seems booked!--and art therapy is working just o.k. for me. I'm incapable of crying and I feel overwhelming rage all the time--sometimes to the point of hurting myself (no worries folks, I haven't actually injured myself). \n\nIf anyone else has gone through this, I'd love it if you reached out to me. If you are going through this, going to the police *can be a positive experience.* Rape is a horrific crime--it's a tragedy that so few report. Hopefully this may serve as a guide to help you make the best choice for yourself in terms of reporting. \n\n**Edit**: Wow, this post really exploded. First of all, it breaks my heart to hear all the stories about rape left in the comments. I really feel for all of you... please, if it happened recently, consider getting a kit. You're not required to report, but, at least in my state, your medical care will be covered. For example, the state is paying for my chlamydia medication.\n\nSecondly, I've been teary from all the heartwarming messages that you've sent me. I was able to be connected to someone who showed me how to get in touch with a local crisis center for therapy, and I've been talking to others that have been in the same emotional place that I'm in now. It makes me feel so much less alone. \n\nFinally, after the case concludes, I promise to follow up.\n\nThank you, stranger, for the gold. Never thought I'd make it to the front page with this story. \n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt"}, {"score": 36, "url": "http://i.imgur.com/hefLKOD.png", "id": "t3_37cncb", "author": "jakemarsh", "title": "Little Bites of Cocoa #7: CLVisit \ud83d\ude98", "timecreated": 1432661316.0, "subreddit": "iOSProgramming", "selftext": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s61a"}, {"score": 31, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Mariners/comments/37dbni/game_chat_526_mariners_2123_rays_2422_410_pm_pt/", "id": "t3_37dbni", "author": "Mariners_bot", "title": "Game Chat: 5/26 Mariners (21-23) @ Rays (24-22) 4:10 PM PT", "timecreated": 1432671032.0, "subreddit": "Mariners", "selftext": "### Mariners (21-23) @ Rays (24-22)\n\nFirst Pitch: 7:10 PM ET at Tropicana Field\n\n |Pitcher|TV|Radio\n-|-|-|-\n[Mariners](/r/mariners)|[J.A.

His massive armored frame dominated the room.\n\n\"Yes,\" the amphibious Pasha replied with a nod, \"Otherwise they'll infest the entire area.\" \n\nThe Hurakani delegate rolled his ten eyes. \"Good, we've settled what to do about the space rats in the mess hall; it only took you ten hours. Now what do we do about the humans?\"\n\nKali'tq'qt'sdf'xv glanced at Earth floating in the black void, then looked at the assembled council with a shrug. \"Iunno. Blow it up?\"\n\nThe ship's AI suddenly butted into the conversation, its voice flat and hollow. \"That course of action is not recommended.\" \n\nAfter some jeers and cries of 'why not?!', the AI brought up a holographic display in the middle of the room and explained. \n\n\"Simulations predict that catastrophic damage to Earth would not kill the humans, and would in fact only antagonize them.\" \n\nKali'tq'qt'sdf'xv slammed his fast on the table again. The table cracked further, but Kali'tq'qt'sdf'xv's exoskeleton suffered far more damage, splitting and shattering open to reveal the soft flesh underneath. He nonchalantly ripped it off, silently cursing himself when he remembered his species couldn't regenerate limbs.\n\n\"Please explain to me exactly *how* they wouldn't die from an asteroid being dropped on them!\"\n\nPasha raised her hand. \"I thought we were going glass it.\" \n\nAnother delegate raised her voice. \"What? We all agreed on an old-fashioned invasion!\" \n\nThen crowd quickly devolved into chaos and argument.\n\n*\"We were gonna virus-bomb it!\"*\n\n*\"Throw it into their sun! Duh!\"*\n\n*\"You're all idiots! We banished them there in the first place so it would kill them!\"*\n\n*\"No we didn't!\"*\n\n*\"Yes we did!\"*\n\nPasha had enough and screamed. \"Enough!\" \n\nThe assembled aliens silence themselves and turned to the serene delegate.\n\n\"We'll just do a combo of all those things, huh? Besides, they're still in the stone age, they won't be able to stop us anyway.\"\n\n\"That is unlikely,\" the AI said. \n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Turn around.\" \n\nPasha complied and whipped back only to see a significantly different Earth. Much of its greenery had shrunk, and countless points of light hovered around the planet in a pale white shimmer.\n\n\"That's...impossible!\" Pasha cried, \"We had our backs turned for literally two minutes!\"\n\n\"This complicates things...\" Kali'tq'qt'sdf'xv mumbled, but then his eyes brightened and his snapped one of his claws. \"I got it! We'll drop *two* asteroids on them!\" \n\nPasha pinched her brow and spoke. \"No! Look. I know a few cosmic horrors and renegade AIs that owe me some favors. I'll call them and we'll get this all sorted out.\"\n\n\"Also will not work,\" the AI replied. \n\nBefore Pasha could ask why, live feeds were brought up from around the galaxy. \n\nThe Iron Cloud's computational matrix was cold and unknowing, its drones lying still in the cold darkness of space.\n\nThe Bio-Horde was black and crisp, its brain spilled over the continents of Mars. \n\nThe Seven Horrors were gone, only bits of their corrupt flesh floating at the edges of the galaxy. \n\nAnd none could find the words to describe what had happened to The Lurking One. \n\nPasha's mouth was agape. \"H-how?!\"\n\nThe AI responded by zooming in one of the Iron Cloud's city-sized drones to show a small group of humans dancing on it, shooting guns in the air and making generally lewd gestures.\n\n\"While you were all arguing,\" the AI said, \"the humans have been having fun.\" \n\nKali'tq'qt'sdf'xv threw his limbs up. \"That's it,\" he stated, \"AI, order the fleets to begin cleansing of the humans.\" \n\nThe AI replied. \"Of course. I will direct the first and second fleets to the nearest staging areas and I will also sniff myself because I am a butt and I love smelling farts.\"\n\nKali'tq'qt'sdf'xv's segmented jaw dropped. \"...Buh?\"\n\nOne of the navigators raised his voice. \"Sir! The AI's been hacked by the humans! They turned all the AI's data files into pictures of skulls!\"\n\nAt that moment, a small furry alien made its way into the center of the meeting room. Carrying a large staff and covered with tribal paint, its squeaky voice almost too much to stand.\n\n\"I warned you all!\" it spat while circling in place, pointing an accusing finger at the assembled crowd, \"But none of you listened! You cannot kill them! You can only plead for your lives! None are safe from The Violent Ones!\"\n\n\"The what?\" Pasha blurted.\n\n\"His species worships the humans. That's what they call them.\" Kali'tq'qt'sdf'xv answered.\n\n\"Fool!\" another squeaky voice shouted at the opposite side of the room. An equally small and adorable alien appeared, wearing garments similar to the first. \"The Ascended shall bring about an era of galactic peace! You spread *heresy!*\" \n\nThe two small rodent-like aliens ran into each other and began to tussle, each screaming litanies and curses at one another. Every few seconds, another alien would join the brawl, hoping to appease The Gods or The High or The Warlords or whatever other colorful names they associated with the humans. \n\nKali'tq'qt'sdf'xv turned away from the madness and looked out the window to see Earth had changed again. The small shoal of ships around the planet had become a near-blanket, and Luna's dark side showed the crisscross of massive settlement as well.\n\nHe turned back. Everyone was wearing human clothes, blue jeans, and several humans were now in the room and shooting their machine guns around randomly. And above it all, horrible human music whined over the loudspeakers.\n\nPasha lowered her oversized sunglasses. \"Hey, man, these humans are pretty cool. Their culture is like, *infectious*, you know?\"\n\nKali'tq'qt'sdf'xv gasped, then looked down. He was wearing blue jeans.\n\nIn a panic, he pushed himself away from the council and into the control room, where all the technicians were also wearing blue jeans. He looked up.

He is older and since I have met him he as always been creepy.  He constantly is trying to put his arm around you, whispering vulgar things in your ear, and asking really personal questions.  If you ignore him or ask him to leave you alone he then takes it out on you when it comes to preparing your food.  \n\nWell today was going as normal, I had tried to avoid him and was doing a pretty good job.  I went down to the kitchen to grab a to go box to find he was standing next to them.  I quickly try to steal one when all of a sudden he grabs me and kisses my neck.  I was so shocked and disgusted I couldn't even think.  My manager was off for the day so at this point there was no one for me to go to.  I didn't go down to the kitchen for the rest of the day and I left from the front door instead of the back.  \n\nAt this point I am so uncomfortable I don't even want to go back in to work.  I have to tell my manager first thing tomorrow but am afraid he wont take me seriously.  Has anyone else ever had a problem like this?  What did you do to fix it?\n\nUPDATE:  I couldn't figure out how to link back to the original from mobile so sorry if this is a mess.  Anyways, I went back up to work this evening and spoke with the owner of the restaurant who was managing tonight.  I told him what happened and he informed me that someone had spoke with him before about the same cook creeping them out but he had never touched them.  He said he was sorry I was made to feel that way and that \"whatever happens will happen swiftly\".  I was then told to go home and get some rest for my shift tomorrow.  Not even an hour after I get home I have a text from the owner that says, \"_aubaub, ____ is no longer employed with us.  Thank you for coming to me.  Rest well and see you tomorrow\".  This situation went better than I ever expected.  A huge weight is off my shoulders knowing that I can go to work tomorrow and not have to worry about this man.  \n\nThank you so much for the kind words from those that commented and for the advice as well.

In other words, replicas are OK.\n\nEDIT: Since everyone is giving me grief about what I paid for the Mosin,  it's not a standard Russian one, it's Finnish.

I've tried a lot of things before I found keto so when I started I was like 'oh well, might as well try.\" especially since it held promise of not giving up what I like to eat (big fan of meat).  \nNow the start wasn't that easy, a lot of figuring out and I was also starting on a budget since I had just lost my job a month or so prior. Started simple, just cut carbs to at max 20g a day and made sure to hit that protein each and every day. Some were easier than others as the start was mostly figuring out how to not be hungry and hit the protein mark, stay below or at (or slightly above) that carb limit.  \n\nEventually I started looking up keto specific recipes (shoutout to /r/ketorecipes ) because, surprise, this was actually working. I was losing weight and before I noticed it other people started noticing it. It was working so well that my mother jumped on it as well (it's been going great for her too) and here I am now.  \nI didn't hit my first goal but I'm not upset. I've come from so far and I can only keep going. I've been in a stall for about two weeks now but I'm staying calm, just keep on keto'ing. I signed up with a gym now too and am slowly working my way into that (I 'm still not that good at social situations).  \nHonestly, the biggest thing I need to watch out for is not going nuts buying clothes. It's insane how being able to shop at 'normal' stores can get to you. I mean, I was actually to buy pants on sale! It's been ages since I've had a size that even went on sale :)\n\nAnyways, thanks for the helpful info I found here, thanks to /r/ketorecipes for keeping it interesting (it really helps to have some variety after a while).

These are just my own personal methods of what worked very well for me, and helped me out of the bitterness stage very quickly.\n\n**Step 1: Tabula rasa**\n\nWhat the fuck is tabula rasa you ask? It is latin for 'blank slate'. It is to me personally the most important step and I like the latin words.\nEverything that has happened in your life up to now is history. Dwelling on paths not chosen is the best way to end up in a cycle of self-pity. Nothing will be the bane of your existence more than regretting the past, that I guarantee.\n\n **Step 2: Adapt or die**\n\nThis links in with step one about regret and a key principle of the red pill. Deal with the facts in front of you and adapt to new situations. The world isn't cruel, people look out for themselves, and you have to look out for yourself. This is how the situation is and either move forward or fall into a ball of self-pity, lazy betaness and you may as well be dead. Just type in ISIS into Google and you will see people with real life and death problems.\n\n**Step 3: Assume the worst**\n\nYou know that feeling you get when you say something really inappropriate and you hope people do not get the wrong impression? Assume they did in every single interaction. This may sound counter productive, and may or may not work for you, but it certainly did for me. If people constantly think the worst of you, you start to be totally natural in conversation and it helped me to sit back and NGAF\n\n**Step 4: See people as a single identity**\n\nWhen I was younger in high school, a lot of girls who were not in the top tier used to like me. Why? Because I was not interested in their physical attributes and I did not care how they viewed me. I was ultra confident and their opinion did not faze me. I was nothing like that with the hot girls, as I was conscious of their appearance and acting the polar opposite of my usual self almost as a defense mechanism of not wanting to screw up. This does not change as you get older, and can apply to interacting with men as well. \nYou should not go around thinking people are beneath you at all, but don't treat new people differently especially women because they are hot. (within boundaries you need to work out for yourself, like with bosses). They have not done anything to earn your respect.\n\n**Step 5: Procrastination**\n\nSeriously do not need to write a lot on this. Make a conscious effort to be doing something constructive every minute of the day. It's ok to day dream for a few minutes, but if you are constantly refreshing your facebook you need to stop, delete it, or kill yourself. You are a fucking riot horse with the blinders on you to stop you getting distracted from the task at hand. Get it done.\nAgain I won't go into detail about what 'constructive' is, there is plenty of info from other red pillers about good hobbies and interests.\n\n\n**Step 6: You can't change the world**\n\nAnother frequent red pill lesson is you can only control yourself. Often the people who think they are going to change the world are often lazy and warped. I do not mean this to mean you can't do something great for humanity but the chances are people won't remember you when you die, and you are setting yourself up for big disappointment. This may not apply to you but if it does, get rid of these delusions of grandeur quick.\nThis links in with changing peoples opinion on issues such as politics. Don't try to do it as it is generally a impossible task and can only lead to more bad than good.\nYou are finland. If you stop all CO2 emissions its not going to affect the rest of the world in reality, since you are small. You can make life great for your country and the people in it, but its unlikely anyone else will follow. (Hypothetical before any killjoys jump in). \n\n**Quick word for newbies**\n\nYou will see a fair bit of dislike on the red pill directed at women which can manifest itself as generalisations of our own. This is a natural response, you just have to make up your own mind about what you see. What is true though, is you have fundamentally been lied to and the Disney dream is unfortunately not real, and 'adapt or die' is the truth.\nBut you must recognise men do some seriously depraved shit as well and while why the motivations behind it are different, are just as bad. If you really want to get over the bitterness towards women, have a browse of liveleak and see what men can do as well.\n\n\nI think there is too much emphasis on women as a whole in the red pill anyway. Members say to 'not put the pussy on the pedestal', but post the most meaningless things about them. Its the same shit on a different day in my opinion. It is the same things we know just constantly churned out from bitter members. Threads posting pseudo science bullshit on dropping testosterone levels for those in LTRs for example . I love TRP, but the moaning all seems like a way of avoiding having to do something with your life. So if you are new, pick and choose the information carefully. You can EASILY sleep into a path of bitterness which makes it even harder to drag yourself out of.\n\n**Quick word on monk mode**\n\nMonk mode sounds great in theory but I find it can be a excuse for people to further isolate themselves from reality. Theory is very important, but experience is just as crucial. I personally think monk mode should be a short process of learning, and then on to basic training. Exposure is key here with all aspects of the red pill, and it is necessary to push yourself to exhaustion everyday until it is cemented. \nYou may not like Will Smith, but he is correct when he says 'Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft'.\n\n\nLeave comments if you disagree/would like to add anything else to it. \n\n\n", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u"}, {"score": 24, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/37eifv/help_i_dont_live_anywhere_near_chicago_but_im/", "id": "t3_37eifv", "author": "oldlamplighter", "title": "[help] I don't live anywhere near Chicago, but I'm being sued by a Chicago-based company, and I'm looking for a Chicago-based lawyer to defend me.", "timecreated": 1432689370.0, "subreddit": "chicago", "selftext": "Long story short: a few years back, I went to a college in Chicago for one semester.

I admitted to a lot of wrong doings, i havent been the best boyfriend i could've been. I had screwed her over a handful of times and i am no proud of any of it. She has lost all trust in me, she says I'm a shady person, but im very open with everything i do. Anyways, about a week ago, we came back to our home town, we would see each other daily now or i planned on it, bc thats how things were a year ago last summer. I picked her up and we proceeded to just hangout and go grab something to snack on like w usually do, again i could see the misery in her, prior to that she hardly replied to my messages and it was always one word responses. I try to bring it up while were together and she said she didn't want to talk about, maybe because it always turns into an argument i didn't want that so i backed off. That same night i proceed to text her about, thinking maybe she'd give in and talk. We have a heart to heart and i decided that if she really wanted to take a break then it was best to just do it, we made some terms, it wouldn't be a long break.. and she cant just cut me off out of the blue which i felt was likely at the time. She said it would be just a break to think things over... she insisted it wasn't a break up, but i now know that that was a lie, she just didn't want to hurt my feelings. \nFast forward a week later, it took a lot out of me to not contact her for an entire week, but i decide to text her, i dont know what happened or what go into her. She was a totally a different person, she was being rude and insincere. I asked to see her, she said she would try to make time within the week and before i could reply (20 mins later) she replies again and says that shed rather not see me at all, or even hear about me. not to talk to her or have any sort of communication with her. I obviously pleaded her to reconsider, the fact that she did t over a text was really shitty. I proceeded to pour my heart out to her and she kept on being rude, it was as if she was eager to leave me.. it got to me, \"am i really that bad of a boyfriend?\" thoughts like that started to sink in. I told her i wouldn't give up on us, id do whatever it takes to make it happen, i told her i wouldn't leave her alone until i made things right, i didn't see it at the time but now looking back on those texts from lat night i can see how it was getting me no where. I stumbled upon this sub while looking for advice and im so glad i did. I've been reading a lot and I've changed my mine, she didnt reply to a heart felt message i sent last and thats the last i plan on saying to her for at least 30 days. I found out today who had been boosting her ego and why she was being so rude, one of her close friends isn't to thrilled about me and since we've been back home she's been feeding her wrong information and twisting things up. Nothing i can do about it now, but it'll only get easier right?... \nAfter doing all the reading and looking over the 20 reasons as to why not to talk to her i can see how it all makes sense, as of right now I'm getting ready, going to celebrate my childhood best friend's 21st birthday, to the strip club we go, i can foresee a lot of drinking.

While I still love him, and it hurts, I knew it was the only thing I could do at that point; partially thanks to reddit. I'd like to say we had a wonderful relationship before, but we didn't. The first eight months were like a blissful dream, but it all just fucking crashed and burned after that. I don't even know why I stayed as long as I did now. I just kept hoping we'd get through it. He cheated on me, 8 months in. Just a kiss, and I forgave him eventually. Shook my trust a huge amount because he'd specifically promised me not to see her alone. Not not to see her; I wasn't that unreasonable, but I had a bad gut feeling and I just wanted assurance. He lied to me about it, and made me feel like a crazy jealous harpy after I got really upset having found out he'd spent the night at hers through a slip of the tongue of his around friends. I spent a whole week that I was staying at his mum's with him lavishing him with all kinds of sexual favours as an apology, because he'd convinced me I was essentially crazy. He only told me two hours before his mum came home. \n\nWe spent the next three years, working to build that trust back up. It was really, really hard. I worked really hard. He worked really hard. It wasn't perfect, but we loved each other, respected each other, and even if he *never* put any credence on my gut feelings, I felt that was okay. I'm a pretty reasonable person, and gut feelings isn't the kind of thing I'd usually put stock in either. I will never doubt my gut again though. Not after all the shit he's put me through.\n\nLong story short, we moved in together a year and a half ago so I could commute to Uni. Unfortunately due a family issue, we couldn't move out for 2 months after Uni started, so I was left commuting 9 hours a day with a chronic illness.\n\nI'm sure you can tell where that ended. I relapsed after Xmas, pretty much wasn't able to do anything for about 6 months. Was very, very ill and very, very depressed. Going to Uni and getting my degree had literally been my life's goal until that point, and realizing that I literally cannot do full time Uni was a blow to the heart. I'm going to have to figure out how to financially support myself to the point where I can pay rent/bills/food AND save for Part-Time Uni, while technically disabled, before I can even go to college. I'm allowed legally work 20 hours a week while being on disability for rehabilitative work, but no where will hire me from both lack of experience and physical capabilities. Stresssss. It's okay, I'll figure it out. Learning coding online. \n\nJust before Xmas, he had two weeks holidays from work around Xmas, first week we just screwed about doing nothing together and in the second week we'd planned to go do things we never had time for. My granny died. I ended up being away for 4 days trying to help my mentally ill mother deal with everything to do with that. Met strangers, was charming despite severe social anxiety. Gave a public speech. Loads of things I was not happy with, but did to support my family. All I asked was he tidied the apartment a bit before I got home... when I got home, not only was the apartment messier than it'd been before I left - but he'd smoked both the weed he'd gotten for himself before I left, and the weed I'd gotten for pain management before I left (only brought a tiny amount with me as didn't want to be smoking during that time) and then replaced my weed with OUR money... and smoked 2/3 of that too.\n\nI came home exhausted, emotionally and physically. In a huge amount of pain, to find him sitting on the couch with things ever worse than when I left and barely any anti-inflammation meds for me left. It was heartbreaking.\n\nAnyway, I was really ill and isolated. He hated his job, but I hated texting him all freaking day while he was in work. We'd have nothing to talk about when he got home if we did, but he was really insistent on it and hated when I didn't reply for hours. He reconnected with an old female friend of his instead and started messaging her all the time, I was like \"Cool, we should meet sometime. Sounds like someone I'd get along with :)\" he came back to me the next day telling me \"She has no interest in ever meeting you, or having anything to do with you.\" I was insulted, so I said that if she felt that way to promise to not speak to her about me at all. If she doesn't want to get to know me, then I don't want her knowing ANYTHING about me.\n\nShe never said that. \n\nI don't know that yet, though, so I'm feeling a little weird. This woman is acting more of a partner than I am, visiting him at work, taking him to dinner, lunch, bringing him gifts in work. Mind you, I'm literally stuck at home trying desperately to keep up some semblance of the housework with my health problems and sort out what I'm going to do with myself. He starts talking about her constantly. Telling me she understands him like I never would. That she's an adult and I'm not (She was older than him, not sure how much) and that I don't understand the world properly.I start feeling insecure, and I tell him as such.\n\nHe tries to explain their relationship as friends by saying \"If we were single, we'd probably have sex.\" Good job, dear. Real good as assuaging my fears. I started getting jealous, and told him as much, but asked him to talk me through it because I didn't want to hurt his friendship with my behavior. I'm a very emotional creature, but I make a rule to temper it with sheer hard logic. You have to work through these things, but there's no reason to be unreasonable about it.\n\nAround this time he started constantly criticizing me and gaslighting me when I tried to bring it up. For those of you who don't know what it means, don't worry I only found out a couple days ago. A friend introduced me to the word, and dear god I wish I'd heard of it sooner. According to google: \"Gaslighting or gas-lighting is a form of mental abuse in which information is twisted or spun, selectively omitted to favor the abuser, or false information is presented with the intent of making victims doubt their own memory, perception, and sanity.\"\n\nLong story short, I'd try to bring up I felt he was disrespecting me with his behavior and the way he spoke to me all the time, and it would end with me sitting there crying and apologizing for ruining our relationship. He convinced me I was so insecure that I was colouring everything he said with a perception of... him hating me? I don't even know anymore. I was stuck in this tiny apartment, and I believed his bullshit. It wasn't until I was well enough for us to go out to dinner with some friends that they felt the need to say something about his behavior towards me. He was so patronizing that *his* best friend felt the need to say something. It was at that moment I realized that I wasn't just nuts, he had been treating me like shit for months, and that his behavior with his female friend (lying to me about seeing her, telling me she had a thing for him and that I was being unreasonable and it didn't matter that he had lied about where he'd been etc. etc.) was totally unreasonable as well. I confronted him on it a few weeks later after I'd been to visit my mum. I wanted to spend some time with him, and he'd been with his dad during the day, so I decided to head home early. I let him know, and immediately got a call.\n\nHe was in the pub, with this woman and her family, for her birthday. He only told me because he knew he'd be caught. I don't even know why he didn't tell me; as I said I'd been as reasonable as possible in not wanting to interfere with his relationship and simply treating it as \"I have an issue that I need to deal with, I'd appreciate some comfort and support to help me through the process, and I trust and care about you\". When he got home I told him it was the last straw, that if we were going to fix things between us I couldn't have that strain hanging over our heads and that it was unacceptable for him to have repeatedly lied to me. That I loved him and this didn't mean they couldn't be friends again, just that I needed her out of our lives while we worked through our issues.\n\nHe **freaked out**. Spent the next hour trying every argument to turn it around on me. I just didn't respond, because if I did I knew he'd manage somehow. Everything from how me being depressed was what was ruining our relationship (My depression is hilarious. The more depressed I get, the more I make myself and those around me smile. It's how I cope. I'm a very positive depressed person.) to \"YOU DIDN'T CARE I WAS SPEAKING WITH HER WHEN YOU DIDN'T KNOW!\"\n\nThat's referring to when he told me that he felt uncomfortable that I felt that way about it, and that he'd decided to stop speaking to her as a result. He then went back to speaking to her without saying anything to me. I was just hella' confused about this one, honestly. Oh, and I found out because he'd left viber open on his computer ( I didn't go snooping, he'd sat me down to play Stanley Parable and when I closed it Viber was open on the 42\" screen right in front of me.) and he'd lied to me about not speaking to her about me. I didn't read it but I confronted him about it, he'd told her fucking everything from my depression to the fact I was jealous to the issues we'd been having. I have no problem that he'd spoken to a friend, and she never did say the thing that made me make him promise that, but... still. I felt like he'd broken my trust. Also, weird thing; don't know the girl, don't want to make judgement, but even after knowing all the shit that she'd been a bit of a focal point for (from his perspective) she asked if she could move in with us. Wtf? He also thought that was okay to ask.\n\nAnyway, back to me saying I couldn't deal with that shit. He agreed to talk later in the week. He had two days off that week; Tuesday and Thursday. I spoke to him Sunday. He asked if we could speak Thursday because he had a trial-day for a new job he really wanted on the Tuesday. Of course I had no problem with that, if he needed time he needed time.\n\nTuesday arrives and he calls the store (not the head office he's dealing with) at 10am WHEN HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE THERE, to say he's got an \"emergency\" (note; unspecified) and can't come in. Few hours later head office calls and is like \"So... heard you didn't show?\" and he repeated that he'd had an emergency and couldn't go in. I tried to explain before he called in that they wouldn't hire him if he did that; especially if he didn't have an actual emergency story. If people really have an emergency, they say \"I'm so sorry, I have a family/child/pet emergency, my X is X.\" They don't just say \"Oh sorry. Emergency. Can't come in.\" He told me I was negative.\n\nRemember earlier when I said he said I didn't understand how the world works? Yeah, he's the one who has that problem.\n\nSo they rescheduled him for Thursday; 10am - 5pm. Thursday arrives, and we go out to dinner when he's done. I'm like \"Would you like to start the conversation here, or prefer to just enjoy our meal and wait until we're home?\" He tells me that because he was working today, he thought we wouldn't speak. Did I mention he just sat around playing video games and smoking weed on the Tuesday? We could have spoken then. I say as much, he says he's been really stressed recently.\n\nI know, I've been trying to support him through it. I've been cleaning and cuddling and cooking and caring my fucking ass off. He says he can't handle to talk, and I just let it go. I'm too tired to fight.\n\nFriday, I wake up at 6am absolutely in bits. I'm miserable. I've been wanting to talk all week, not in a great place emotionally, very upset, but instead I put all my focus onto making sure HE was okay. Making sure HE had what HE needed. I go into the living room, and start to cry; not wanting to wake him because he has work at 12. But you know, sometimes you just gotta' let that shit out.\n\nAbout an hour later he wakes up and comes looking for me because I'm not in bed. He comes in, finds me still there doing the whole cathartic thing, and asks me what's wrong. I'm just like \"...Are you serious dude? Really?\" and tell him that I'm incredibly upset because of the shit that's been going on and that the last week has been really difficult for me as I feel like I'm in a space of limbo. He offers to talk, I jump at the chance. It goes really badly; he did not want to talk. I think he felt he was pushed into a corner, but like... I didn't even ask to talk. I was literally just telling him why I was crying. I assumed he wouldn't offer if he wasn't up for it.\n\nIt was awful. He said awful things to me, I ended up losing my temper finally (hard to rile, explosively loud when done so) and yelling at him. Before we know it he has to leave for work, he's point blank refusing to give up his friendship at all. Even for a limited amount of time while we sort things. I ask if there's a chance we're going to work through this and talk things out. He says \"I don't think so. I can't think about it right now\" I go and stay at a mutual friends for the night.\n\nThe next day I ask him again \"Are we going to talk about this and try sort things out?\" He essentially said he didn't want to speak about it and couldn't deal with it right now... so I left the apartment. I packed a bunch of my things, took my cat, and went to my mothers. I told him that I couldn't live with him if our circumstances were like that, and that I think that we needed some space and that when he was ready I would be waiting to listen to him. \n\nTo paraphrase; I spent the next three months taking care of his kitten that he was leaving alone in an apartment for up to 12 hours at a time, and four months looking after him. He kept asking me to stay until he got home, or stay the night. I could have just dropped in for a few hours during the day to mind the cat, but he always insisted I stayed around and acted hurt and upset when I didn't. He says he can't deal with work and moving out and everything at once, so can we talk about it all when he's back in his mum's? I agree. Four months. Four freaking months, I tried to care for him. I loved him, I cooked for him, I cleaned the apartment just fucking... everything I could. He was severely depressed; still is, but his depression brought out the absolute worst in him it seems. Which you know, isn't okay. It's one thing to be a bit snappy - it's another to lie to your partner about things, give out to them for the way they do everything from cooking rice to taking calming breaths during arguments. Seriously, it got to the point where he was criticizing me for taking a deep breath to keep calm when he was being an idiot. I wouldn't have phrased it that way before, but at this point I suppose I'm bitter. He was the type to argue for the sake of arguing, so sometimes he'd say things that I *knew* he didn't believe and was just saying because, and I'd have to try calm myself down because you know... that shit's annoying as fuck.\n\nAnyway, he took four months to move back to his mothers. He took advantage of my love and hospitality. He emotionally manipulated me on a huge amount of levels. He may have cheated on me; I don't know what to believe about him anymore. I think I may have fallen in love with the man he presented himself to be. \n\nWhen he finally moved back home, he put us off talking 3 times for stupid, easily avoided reasons. Once was that he'd *forgotten the day he'd picked was his mothers freaking birthday.* I'm talking that level of stupid. I realized I had to leave him.\n\nHe'd insisted we wrote letters to each other to explain how we felt for our \"talk\", so I wrote him one. It was as fair as I could make it; I poured out my love, my hurt and my sadness over how he'd treated me. I wasn't cruel, I wasn't harsh. I got a mutual friend to read it to make sure I wasn't being too mean anywhere, because while as gentle as I could make it he'd been incredibly immature and uncool (fuck, even emotionally abusive) in the last while and I wasn't going to sugar coat that. \n\nHe didn't even write one for me. When I told him I was leaving him, he only said \"I know this is kind of inappropriate, but I'm relieved\" He had nothing else to say other than \"I love you\" and \"I'm sorry\". Oh and that I'd been suffocating him by being at the apartment so much when he'd been the one asking me to be there. He essentially invalidated ALL my effort I'd been making for months. I made a huge fucking effort to make sure he was okay through it all. I put my own needs aside for months for him, and he just fucking blew it off. He said, on the day, that he'd write me a reply to MY letter to HIM. I'd just wanted his thoughts, not his thoughts in relation to mine... but better than nothing. He hasn't, and I don't think he will. To this day, that other woman knows more about what went wrong in my relationship from my partner's side than I do, and that's kind of killing me a bit.  I'll get over it I'm sure. It's getting easier.\n\nBut I miss my partner. I miss the man who made me laugh and smile and feel beautiful. I miss the man who thought I was intelligent and respected my opinions and feelings. Who made me feel things I genuinely thought were made up when I'd read about them in books. Who made me love the world and excited for our future.\n\nBefore this all happened, we'd been talking about what we were going to do. We were planning to move somewhere further from the city, with a garden for both us and the cats. We were building a future together. For years he was a bit annoyed that I referred to things more as \"You and Me\" than \"Us\", but when we moved in...\n\nI considered him my husband in all but law. Had he treated me right, I would have done anything for him. Fuck, he treated me like shit and I still wasted a whole 9 months of my life trailing after him like a lost puppy trying to do everything I could for him.\n\nI know I said I was annoyed he insisted on texting me all the time, but now to go from CONSTANT contact for the last 4 years to nothing is really hard. I miss him. I miss the man I fell in love with. I miss the life we had together. I now own his cat too because he's too much of a man-child to take care of him. There's so many more not-okay things he did, or didn't do for that matter. I know I did the right thing, and I hope he grows up and cops on.\n\nBut I don't know how I'm going to move passed this. I'm so incredibly beaten down and hurt; I mean I'll get back up and just keep going... but I feel scarred. I already had a lot of trust issues and I feel like being with anyone in that sense is just... something I'll never be able to do again. I'm not saying \"OH IF I CAN'T HAVE HIM I DON'T WANT ANYONE\"\n\nI would like to fall in love again someday. I think it'd be lovely. I mean more... I think this has genuinely damaged me emotionally, and I can't really understand it at all because I don't understand his side and I just...\n\nYou can probably tell I'm rather at a loss. I don't know why I'm spilling all this, but I needed to tell someone how I felt. Like no matter how wonderful a person comes along in the future, because of this dipshit I won't be able to trust in them. That I have been irrevocably altered by this experience, and while I'm stronger for it, I feel I've lost something very important.\n\n**TL;DR** Asshat boyfriend was emotionally abusive, have been emotionally effected by the utter mindfuckery. Feel like I've lost something really important and don't know if I'll ever be able to trust in a person like that again. For context, already had trust issues so not trying to be melodramatic.

Level one.  \n  \nBut we've been here before.  This isn't a different product, just a different flavor.  \n  \nI sit in a strange city in a part of the country I've never lived in before.  I moved here to this little townhouse after being unjustly removed from my previous assignment.  I came here with nowhere to live, no car, no phone, no furniture or real belongings, and only a little bit of money to my name.  I'm out of shape.  I don't know anyone here.  I'm fucking broke, and I left every girl I knew back in Dubai.    \n  \n**Good**.  Because this is where I want to be: the bottom.  Maybe you've been here too.  Maybe you are here now.  It's easy to spout bullshit from the peaks of success mountain, but where's the authenticity in that?  I want to show you that it's possible, in real time.  If you have your own valley you've been languishing in, it's time to come out of it.  We can do this, and we don't need some perfect road map either.  **We'll do it live.**  \n  \nWay I see it, there are seven Fs on the road to success, and I need to work on just about all of them right now.  Maybe you do too.  Let's get to work.\n  \n---------------  \n  \n##Fitness  \n  \nI got out of shape.  My muscles atrophied from months of neglect and I can no longer pretend those are abs in the mirror.  **Good**.  The guy in Elder Scrolls: Oblivion didn't whine about how shitty things had gotten when Jean Luc Picard woke him up, did he?  No, he got his ass up, headed across that moat, and started picking up some fucking quests.  \n  \n*Let's do the same*.  I went to the gym for the first time today in at least 6 months.  The secret to fitness is a subject for a follow up entry, but in essence it's this: **intensity**.  It doesn't matter how technical you get with your workouts; if the intensity isn't there you won't grow muscle and burn fat.  That's why fluffy lifting machines and bullshit elliptical machines tend to attract the people who don't make any gains: because they are looking for the easy way out.  Elliptical curves are usually a good thing, but not in this case.  \n  \nI'm sure I looked quite silly.  I was barely able to do a few dips, pull ups, squats, and free weight flys (+pushups), but my body was wrecked today.  I'll be sore tomorrow.  And it will be forced to change.  Your body doesn't *want* to change; it likes itself the way it is.  You have to give it a *reason* to transform.  \n  \n**I will work out at least 5 times a week, starting today, and will get into the best shape of my life.  No more Taco Bell and Weird Japanese Sex Games.  It's time for Free weights and Subway.**  \n  \nI always wanted a crypto-nerd bank account, but never a crypto-nerd body.  Vorhees?  You listening?  You're about to be a captain of the industry.  It's time to hit the gym too, so the temple matches the master that lives inside.  \n  \n-------------------------  \n  \n##Finances  \n  \nI'm effectively broke.  I had to liquidate some bitcoins to buy a car, pay my first months rent here at this new place, and buy enough furniture so I'm not sleeping on a floor.  The rest of my crypto holdings rest in Monero and bitcoin, and those aren't coming out.  I will slowly save up and continue buying these two assets every month, and avoid any excess luxuries for now.  The most important thing is to be investing in something you believe in long term, and I feel that these two cryptos will be very big deals in coming years.  \n  \nI got a couch, kitchen, bed, and good clothes.  The rest will come in time.  I bought a much cheaper car than what I'm used to driving, but I'm gonna have fun with it.  As a result, I don't have a car payment: that's a good thing.  And for $2500, it was a good deal.  It will do until I can afford the 2017 Chevy Camaro. (see separate car thread for the full glory of my current chariot)  \n  \nAlso, no Netflix or Playstation 4 is going to be useful for the next part:  \n  \n-----------------  \n  \n##Finishing  \n \nThrough a haze of alcohol and sex while living in Dubai, I somehow managed to write 110,000 words of a pretty damn good novel.  It's got it's problems, but I've got a skilled editor working on those, and my illustrator has done some fine work as well.  \n  \nI've been in a depression while moving this past month though and haven't worked on it.  Shame, shame on me.  \n  \nTime to fix that.  500 to 1000 new words every day, no exceptions, and lets finish up *Labrys* and release this thing.  I think that if I can control my AADD and bipolar mania enough to write and release an entire book, then that means I can do anything.  I'm gonna John Nash this shit: the problem is within the mind, and I can fix it.  \n  \nFocus through the haze and fog of creativity, and **finish. the. damn. thing.**  \n  \nAnd when I'm done with that?  I need to start on *Greater Expectations* and work on marketing Labrys.  Personal legacy never ends.  \n  \nWhat's your project you never finished?  That you know you need to put some work into?  \n  \n-------------------  \n  \n##Fraternity & Flirting:  \n  \nI can't be a hermit.  It isn't good for the mind.  And not knowing people is no excuse.  Waiting on the body to be finalized isn't an excuse not to go out and start talking to girls, and making friends immediately.  \n  \nYou gotta put yourself out there.  \n  \nIt's Friday and I'm heading out tonight for a beer.  I asked some locals for the names of some good bars, and the bar is low for the first night out on a town: dress nice, and chat up at least two or three women I don't know that are at least 7/10 cute.  If I meet any cool dudes, that's fine too.  \n  \nFor those of you who aren't going to do this, why?  I just got done telling you: I'm not in shape, my car is a very special work of art, I'm dead ass broke, and hell, my house consists of a couch and an inflatable mattress in it.  And yet I'm gonna go meet some girls tonight.  Maybe they won't like me.  **Good.**  \n  \nBecause I assign myself A's for effort, and you should too.  Only an idiot thinks he will write the greatest novel of all time having never practiced his writing.  **And only an idiot thinks he will one day meet the woman of his dreams without practicing and failing first**.  \n  \n---------------  \n  \n##Failure  \n\nIn life, you can't be afraid to fail.  I have tasted failure.  It isn't that bad.  It hurts, sure.  \n  \nSometimes it hurts badly.  \n  \nBut I've also pussied out on opportunities and dreams in my life, and let me tell you something: **that hurts a lot worse**.  \n  \nSo let's dare to fail this summer.  I just got done failing at the gym, but I'll be better next time.  I just got done failing at a job, but I'm going to be damn good at this one.  I just got done failing at finances, having to spend a big chunk of my savings to reboot my life, but I'll put those pieces back together. \n  \n**And I guarantee that tonight some girl is going to either not meet my standards, or I won't meet hers.**  I will fail at that too.  *And that's ok*.  \n  \nYou're not perfect.  Stop trying to be.  You are worthless, and small, and insignificant, and instead of depressing you- that should inspire you.  \n  \nThere's nothing at stake.  You didn't exist until a few years ago, and pretty soon you probably won't exist again.  So stop worrying about failing.  It's time to kill the ego and start building up your character one exp point at a time.  \n  \n*Eventually we'll level up.*  And then I'm gonna pick a perk.  \n  \n----------------  \n\n##Fashion  \n  \nI got this down.  You should too.  A few expensive Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein pieces with some practical American Eagle + H&M.  Either shave clean or trim your god-damned neckbeard.  Get a fucking haircut you hippy; if you don't know what you should do, take a chance and let a top shelf hairdresser go to town on you.  Take a risk.  And scientists can spout the dangers of the sun all they want: we didn't evolve in fucking caves, and the human body is supposed to get regular exposure to UVA + UVB radiation (aka sunlight).  A vitamin D3 deficiency will fuck you up real quick (Google it if you don't know what I'm talking about); you will be depressed and that black shadow on your chest will consume you without sunlight exposure or D3 supplementation.... but we digress, (even though a tan **will** automatically make you more attractive).  Let's get back on topic.  \n\nIf you dress like a clown, and look like a clown, prepare to be treated like a clown.  People will accept the reality you present them with.  \n  \nA clean homeless man in a blazer with a crispy button-up shirt will get treated better than the billionaire in a wifebeater.  \n  \nWhy do people wait until they are successful to dress nicely?  Success is a state of mind.  Invest in some high quality clothes and act the damn part.  You don't need a big wardrobe, just a solid one.  \n \nAnd this final 'F' wraps back around to the first one: because a ripped dude looks good in *any* shirt.  So get your lift and run on.  If there are any women reading this (and I highly doubt any of my 106 subscribers is female, but who knows) then the same applies: nothing tastes better than being skinny and there's no better feeling than looking fantastic in every single piece in the store.  \n  \n--------------------  \n  \nThat's the seven 'F's of the Game of Money (because ultimately all success is money).  If you do the first seven 'F's right, the eighth will come naturally.  **If you have something you want to work on, and you want some tough public accountability for it, you are welcome to comment too at the stickied topic at /r/americanpegasus.**  I'll be making a new top level comment for each day, allowing people to discuss and boast about their progress.

I peaked at Diamond 1 last season by playing Orianna and have almost exclusively been a mid main, with ADC being my weakest role.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was asked to perform at a tournament whilst playing ADC. I accepted seeing it as a good opportunity to get my ADC up to par. My mechanics are not terrible and neither is my creep score; my main weakness is that I am used to playing aggro in the mid game (with mages like Orianna or Syndra), rather than feeling weak in the mid game and hoping that late game can hurry up.\n\nAs a result I've been playing a lot of Sivir. We've been running a 4 man push comp and it worked fairly well - we won 7 games in a row and our MMR skyrocketed all the way up to masters/challenger ranked 5s level (seriously, we were playing against full challenger/master teams). However we lost two games due to mistakes that were made and I feel that we lost these partially due to my lack of flexibility in ADC choice, which is mainly caused by inexperience and inability to itemize.\n\nTo that end: I tried to pick up Jinx to add to my repetoire. I can play the new Ashe, Kalista, Caitlyn and Vayne fairly well, but Jinx is fairly strong right now and is exactly the mix of what we need - fairly decent mid game, strong tower pushing early and a beastly hyper carry for our Juggermaw comp. Also has the added side effect of not letting the enemy team take Jinx, which means as long as they don't take Sivir we practically always win a 4 man push with Nunu.\n\nMy problem is itemization on her and to a lesser extent Sivir. On one hand, with our 4 man push team, Statikk Shiv makes me able to push harder (yes, even on Sivir), gives me a nice little burst of damage every few auto attacks, a little more mobility than PD and lets me deal with resilient tanks a little faster before getting my PD. It also makes our push stronger because we waveclear faster = more hits on a tower.\n\nOn the other hand - Jinx is a late game carry, and Sivir already has good waveclear. PD would be good for the higher crit change percentage and also the passive makes kiting in lanes a breeze. But it's also significantly more expensive.\n\nI'm just wondering whether someone could give me an idea of when I should pick one over the other? Right now I am defaulting to shiv because of it's price but I feel this is not always the correct decision.\n\nFurther, another discussion point is when should I finish BT instead of going vamp into PD. A lot of fights (especially on Sivir with her low range) I found I was having to back off a LOT because I simply didn't have enough sustain to live through fights. But in one of the games we lost, I had finished BT and ended up just not doing enough damage to the herp derp Thornmail Rekt'sai and I feel maybe a Vamp -> LW + Red pot would have been better than BT + pickaxe.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3"}, {"score": 1277, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/millionairemakers/comments/373ezv/i_won_my_mom_is_going_to_be_so_proud/", "id": "t3_373ezv", "author": "esoterics", "title": "I won!

The donations keep coming in along with so many kind words and excellent suggestions. It has already been a deeply life-changing experience for me to be a part of this. I can't even begin to express my profound sense of gratitude for so many people coming together with such unexpected gestures of kindness. \n\nThank you so so much.

I just try not to think about it too much or I would never sleep.  \n\n Classes start tomorrow. You will have made it possible for me to walk through those doors with a little more confidence and a lot less apprehension. Each one of you did that for me and I will never forget it. Thank you and good night.\n\n**Update 4** Still going! I hope everyone had a great weekend, especially those who were enjoying the holiday yesterday. I know I did because I'm now $3,200 less broke and it feels so good. I think tonight I have enough time to treat my mom. Gonna buy some slightly fancy groceries and cook a good meal at home.

Though native to Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, it has flourished throughout the milder European nations, and can be found particularly in Southern England and Wales. As an annual, it needs to be sown every year, so do be aware that if you are cultivating it you will need to gather seed every year.\n\nAs a short (60cm) herbaceous plant, it lacks a wooded stem and instead has a reddy-green stem. It branches substantially, and often grows what would appear to be an excessive number of leaves and flowerheads. Its leaves are long, reasonably narrow, and possess moderately prominent veins. The leaves end in prickles, and it strongly resembles the Scottish thistle in leaf and flower shape. All parts of the plant are covered in a thin, sometimes-spiky down-like coating of fine hairs. The flowers are usually a pale yellow, and appear very similar to more common thistle species. \n\nGenerally it flowers in mid-July to early August, and just as the plant begins to bloom the flowering heads can be harvested and dried ready for usage. The leaves are also used, so harvesting entire stems is recommended.  \n\nIf you are looking to collect this wild, please do ensure that you have **not confused this plant with the unrelated milk-thistle**. The milk-thistle, or *Silybum marianum*, is often confused and is medicinal in its own right, in other ways. Please consult a foraging guide to compare the two.\n\n*****\n\n**Uses**\n\n*****\n\nTraditionally, blessed thistle is indicated for a variety of uses, including as a stimulant, a diaphoretic, an emetic and a galactagogue. It has also been suggested for the treatment of skin disorders, such as plantar warts and boils. \n\nIn high dosages, infusions and extracts of blessed thistle have a similar action to syrup of ipecac, acting as an emetic that is described (unverified) as being of \"low inconvenience\". Taking more than \"a teacup\" of a normal boiling-water-prepared tea steeped until at least lukewarm will inducing vomiting, so please do be careful when using blessed thistle. After consulting with many experts in amateur studies (read, \"asked some random people\"), I have concluded that a teacupful probably means about 200ml. However, I would recommend that if you are seeking to **avoid** emesis, one should keep dosages below 100ml if you are using it as a tea. Blessed thistle appears to be quite potent in that regard.\n\nThe tea is generally prepared by adding 30g of dried herb to 500ml of boiling water, then leaving to stew til lukewarm. It can then be decanted off, and the tea left to chill until needed. Discard it after five - seven days if unused, because the active compounds will denature over time.\n\nIn lower dosages (approximately 75ml of tea or 1 - 2ml of extract. 7ml of 25% ethanol tincture is interchangeable with extract), blessed thistle tea has been indicated as an aid for digestion, especially those who have poor appetite. Please note that poor appetite is often referred to in medical and herbalist literature as \"anorexia\": this is NOT the same as anorexia nervosa, which is a mental health condition and *must* be seen by a licenced *psychiatrist* (not a therapist or psychologist). Anorexia on its own refers to a loss of appetite, and is often associated with viral infections, stomach flu, hiatus hernia, chronic indigestion and other conditions. If you are experiencing upper abdominal pains, especially when breathing, do please consult a doctor as you may be experiencing hiatus hernia, which is a serious but non-life-threatening medical condition.\n\nBlessed thistle is a cholagogue, which means it stimulates the release and production of bile. This is a substance produced by the liver and released by the gallbladder that aids in the digestion of fats. Thus, those who have had highly calorific meals or very rich, fatty meals who might otherwise have issues with steatorrhea, diarrhea, indigestion or similar from their food can use this tea as a prophylactic treatment. \n\nChronic usage of low dosages of blessed thistle tea or tincture/extract (the latter is recommended due to the amount of time this must be taken over) has been well-recommended as a verified treatment for low milk production in both humans and livestock. 1-2ml of extract or 7ml-9ml of tincture (recommended to start with 1ml/6ml and increase slowly if needed) taken twice-daily with meals in the morning and night should be sufficient to increase milkflow. Those who seek to induce lactation without previously having had a baby should take it thrice-daily in conjunction with other treatments such as fenugreek and extensive, thrice-daily breast stimulation. Consult a lactation specialist or better yet an Ob/Gyn or midwife if you are concerned about your technique. I am also happy to provide guidesheets on request.\n\nBlessed thistle has been used, additionally, for those who have difficulty perspiring, possibly due to skin conditions not otherwise specified. Daily use of low-dose (75ml) tea should be sufficient to increase readiness of sweating. This is also a side effect for those who seek other uses of this herb.\n\nSome say 100ml of the tea can be a good treatment for headaches and migraines; I've never found any evidence in its favour, but then again I've never found any evidence to the contrary either. Have a go, but take an aspirin if it doesn't help. Who knows, perhaps it will work! Feverfew is definitely more efficacious, however, if it does work, so bear this in mind.\n\nSome allege that you can use this plant to ward off viruses, bacteria and other infections. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be the case, and instead this seems to simply be a hang-over from the days when it was believed to keep away the noxious miasmas that caused bubonic plague. Use elderflower instead if you are looking to avoid viral infections, or antibiotic plants (check the subreddit search) for bacterial ones. Crampball fungus is a good antibacterial treatment for lacerations or abrasions of the skin.\n\nAs a minor constituent of some anti-inflammatory poultices, blessed thistle may have benefit to those with arthritic joints. Do not rely on it to the exclusion of other plants, but it does have some effect and appears to increase the benefits of other anti-inflammatories beyond the sum of the constituent parts.\n\nLast but not least... you can, if you're really in a pickle, actually eat this! Like many thistles (but NOT all), blessed thistle leaves can, when young and steamed lightly, be used as a green leafy vegetable in early spring and summer when not all the plants are out yet. It's not recommended in high dosages or too frequently, because it might cause vomiting if you eat too much, but it's a good source of nutrients so a few handfuls of leaves every few days wouldn't hurt in a survival situation!\n\n*****\n\n**Contraindications to Use**\n\n*****\n\n* **Pregnancy**: Whilst this DOES appear safe to use during breastfeeding (in low dosages at least, like those recommended to induce lactation), it has been reported to increase the risk of early labour, abortions and stillbirths if taken during pregnancy. It is especially to be avoided in the first and second trimesters! Ask your midwife or obstetrician if you are unsure. \n\n\n\n* **Indigestion medications**: It's not that it'll interact badly, but they'll probably cancel each other out. If you're using one, don't bother with the other if the one you're taking already works. If not, try a change.\n\n\n\n* **Intestinal disorders such as Crohn's**: There's a lot of evidence that blessed thistle isn't good for inflammatory bowel conditions, so you should probably stay away from it if you have these conditions. This also applies to **ulcers**, so stay clear if you have inflamed bowels or ulcerated ones.\n\n\n\n**Echniacea, mugwort, wormwood, other Artemisia**: Bad interactions can occur. You should also avoid if you have an allergy to any member of Asteraceae, since it seems to be quite easy to be allergic to blessed thistle.\n\n*****\n\n*^(The above guide is intended as a strictly educational notice, and is no substitute for formal instruction in herbalism, foraging, bushcraft, survival or medicine.

It is an absolute single player destroyer if despite my mediocrity, somehow my character is the only one who can make a difference or change things.\n\nLet's take Dead Island for example. What a shithouse of a game this was. Now, they could have done something really interesting here, and take after The Walking Dead. You meet survivors, grow a genuine bond with them and get to know the characters along the way, and you are one of them. You're not a leader, you're not God, you're one of them. A survivor. Instead, what we get is a lazy fetch quest campaign that revolves around YOU and solely YOU doing things for other people. There's no working as a team, no getting to interact with people in a realistic way, it's a lifeless fetch quest form of storytelling where YOU are the only one that does anything. It's just an absolute shambles.\n\nThen we have Battlefield 4. Another shithouse of a campaign. I had this funny experience about an hour ago during a mission where you have to go to Old Town or something, and along your way there are tanks and soldiers aplenty. Now, the funny thing is, if you get spotted, YOU are the only person they go after. You're with 2 other soldiers, and they don't care. This is a pattern throughout the whole game, as you're one member of a team, yet they ALWAYS go for you. They may not even know directly where you are, but they'll always tell which wall you're hiding behind or whatever. Anyway, when we got spotted, I hid in a house, and what made me laugh was how the tank would then move to where I was positioned within the house. It cannot see me, but it knows. I go to the right window, the tank will move along the road to the right side, and same with the left. It's fucking ridiculous, and whilst this is happening, my teammates are doing whatever the fuck they're doing, and the enemies won't die. They do fuck all. Once again, I am the only one who can do anything.\nWhat makes this worse is the fact that the main character is the Squad Leader, but he doesn't speak. You can't command your team to do this or that, there's no life to it, and the enemies shouldn't even know you're Squad Leader anyway.\n\nNow let's go to The Witcher 3. The main character is more than the average person, and the narrative means that it makes complete sense for him to be the one to help people on these quests, and be something more special. You aren't a peasant, and it feels like the gameplay matches the narrative perfectly in a way Dead Island, Battlefield 4, and many other first and third person shooters do. Even Advanced Warfare does it well, as you work in a team and you can flank enemies as they shoot your allies. It's such a simple thing that completely changes everything.\n\nThe Last of Us also does this largely right, because despite Ellie being ignored by the enemies because of how hard that mechanic would be to implement, when you say fight with a few survivors, you aren't the only one who can do things or aimed at. Ellie can distract people, Tommy can kill people, it just feels better. Ultimately sure your contribution is needed to further the plot, but overall you aren't the person relied on.\n\nMaking the gamer so important only works in the right context. I shouldn't be the only survivor to do anything, or the only soldier who can kill enemies or be targeted at. It's plain and simply lazy, and it completely destroys the realism or fun you can get from these modes. Whether it be you working in a team but you're the only one noticed, or whether you're one of many average Joe's but are tasked to do everything, this shit needs to change.\n\nTL;DR: Games should only make the gamer important if the narrative justifies it.

Unfortunately, I got the time wrong and we missed it. Saw him later though.\n\nSo we have time to kill. Normally we would have went back to our place and watched some t.v. and chilled the rest of the night. However, we decide to go get some frozen yogurt. Then she has this idea to go out to the beach by a lake an hour away. We had gone there on a date a couple years back wen we were dating. So we eat our frozen yogurt in the car on the way there.\n\nWhen we arrive some people leaving give us their parking pass. As we walk around on the beach we notice a trail that we hadn't before that leads up into the mountain around the lake. We begin hiking at sunset looking at some pretty awesome views with a sunset sky, sparkling water, twinkling lights in the distance from the marina, and the smell of campfire nestles our noses. We continue hiking and talking about what not. Just talking it was nice. It turns into a night hike. I'm in sandals, she is in her Chuck Taylor's and the trail is adventurous through thick canopies and tall grass. We even pass a man fishing with his son. It gets darker and we head back to the beach.\n\nWe sit on the beach watching the tide slowly come in towards us. We begin talking of our goals, dreams and what we want to do with our lives. Cutting back on tv, games. Making goals to get out more often and see the world around us. I open up about a goal I have that is really important to me but I have a little bit of fear to pursue it. She tells me how she will support me and plans to take to help make it a reality and we do the same for her goals. We then lay back in the sand and look at the millions of stars and she teaches me how to find the North star.\n\nShe gets up to stretch her legs and I'm still laying on my back.\n\n\"Hey! What the... hey! Look at this,\" she stammers.\n\nI rise up and this stampede of 30-35 wild horses are coming right at us full gallop. The horses gallop by like 10 feet from us. You could feel their raw power. They went and drank from the lake and stood around on the beach.\n\nOn our drive back we thought about the experience that we just had. We thought that maybe the horses were God's way of telling us that we needed to go after those goals and  dreams we talked about, to live up to our potential and let ourselves be free. Free from addiction, free as human beings, free from a drab unfulfilling life!\n\nIt's amazing what awaits you in the world when you leave the computer or phone from porn.

However, I'm in a bit of a rut with it, and hoping my fellow oily-skinned makeup lovers can help.\n\nThe issue is that my skin is differing levels of oily...my nose is extremely oily, while the rest of my face is only moderately oily. Thus, using a mattifying/oil-control foundation means that most of my face stays matte all day, while my nose gets shiny (and the makeup breaks apart a little) fairly early on. Powder can prolong the inevitable a little, but only so much. For obvious reasons, this is not my desired look. \n\nSo, I've recently decided to make the switch to a foundation without a matte finish. Looking \"dewy\" isn't my favorite thing in the world, but at this point I think it might be worth it to make my face at least look consistent. My main concern is whether this will make me even greasier in the long term...I know the prevailing wisdom is, \"oily skin = dehydrated\", but I've had experiences with super-moisturizing products increasing my oil production (I'm looking at you, CeraVe cream). \n\nSo, all that to say: have any of you with oily skin tried this approach? How did it work for you?\n\n**edit:** Thanks so much for your input, everyone!

Maybe a more coherent one than my previous post here. :)\n\nA good basic explanation of the New Age happenings can be read [here](http://www.new-age-of-aquarius.com/age-of-aquarius.html), if you don't mind the design of that page. ;)\n\nThe main underlying theme is that our world is supposedly not as materialistic, as our understanding of classical physics told us. Our current classical interpretation is that either random plays a major role, or some small-scale mechanism that we don't fully understand yet creates a pseudo-randomness, from which everything else emerges. Evolution created life, life got increasingly complex, problem-solving ability became an evolutionary advantage, so eventually humans with a conscious mind emerged. So mind is emerging after matter.\n\nWhat made my classical understanding crumble are some sources of information that I discovered recently. There is Dolores Cannon, a hypnosis therapist who specializes in past life regression. A recurring theme came up in her therapy sessions, which is that people had earlier lives on different planets than Earth. These aliens from earlier life then told Dolores Cannon a lot of the aliens's understanding of metaphysics and how the multiverse works. Of course I didn't believe everything right away. We do not know how the human mind works and it is entirely possible that the described workings of the multiverse are expressions of the wishes of Dolores's customers. The multiverse as described by Dolores's customers sounds like the best possible version of existence after all.\n\nThe next big thing I discovered is channeling. The most prominent channel is Darryl Anka channeling someone called Bashar. There's a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWDPG5sZXNcJ3Xj4KwXaE3g) with lots of channeling sessions. Bashar also explains how the multiverse works, similar to the aliens coming up in Dolores's sessions. Bashar's explanations turn out to be very consistent with the information from the hypnotherapy sessions. They basically describe the same theories like the eternal soul, the existence of aliens and another theme called the \"awakening\" or \"new earth\".\n\nThe \"awakening\" in New Age theory is basically a theme for life. The theory is that before we reincarnate, we select a theme for the life we want to experience. To make life interesting, we don't give ourselves unlimited power, but some restrictions like the existence of space and time and the limitedness of some resources. And because we like solving riddles, we make the whole life a big riddle. The goal of life is to figure it out. And because we are a bit crazy, we imagine the best possible mind fuck to experience, which is to completely forget what we are, and slowly rediscovering that we can overcome our restrictions if we really want to. Because we made our life's restrictions ourselves, we could theoretically remove them, but we chose to forget that we can do that before we reincarnated. Remembering what we are is called \"awakening\" or \"ascension\" or \"conciousness shift\". To guide us, we decided that we are not alone in this world, but there are a lot of other people around us, who are exploring their versions of the life's theme. These other people show us alternative ways to go through life and alternative belief systems. The \"New Earth\" is a future timeline leading to the awakening. The \"Old Earth\" is a timeline for choosing to still believe that life is materialistic. By believing in New Earth and being excited about it we can choose to go down that path.\n\nThese are nice theories for themselves, but what really hit me like a truck is the consistency of everything in these theories and other stuff that I stumbled upon. And things I know for a long time suddenly fit into this theme. Some things in physics indicate that the universe might be more subjective than we think. The theory of relativity makes most sense when the universe is subjective and we are always in the center of it, so the speed of light is always the same no matter how we move. In quantum physics the measurements (=our perception) change the outcome of experiments. Out of body experiences indicate that there is more outside of our lives. In many religions there is either reincarnation or an eternal non-physical plane of existence where our soul continues to exist. The multiverse theories are also very consistent with the artifacts described in /r/Glitch_In_The_Matrix.\n\nBecause I'm so used to the materialistic world view I still continue to have some scepticism.

Greg won\u2019t kill her, but he does get to have his fun, and once he's done, I get her, in exchange for having saved his life during the earth\u2019s crust fiasco. So, That was the best deal I could make. I'd rather her be unharmed for what I had in mind, but it was better than a corpse.\n\n\n*You treat this like she's nothing but a bartering piece, not a person.*\n\n\nAfter dropping Psycho off at the hospital I got back onto the radio with Greg to get his location. I laughed when he told me where she was, she wasn't anywhere where the others were searching. This was gonna be a long haul.\n\n\nPulling up to the [REDACTED] I could see that there was already a jeep with several white bags piled in the rear parked nearby; it was probably Greg's. I kicked out the stand on my motorbike and pulled my rifle off of the side of the bike before getting off of it. Dismounting my bike I grabbed my pack and set off inside.\n\n\nIt took awhile to find the right room; I'll be honest, the only reason I found the right room was by following the screams. Musty, dark, damp, it was the perfect place to keep someone who you didn\u2019t want found. The bare concrete that lined the floors and walls seemed especially uninviting to someone who was here against their will. *Reminds me of the place that the SSOA threw us in before they tried to kill us. Remember? You took a bullet there for that bitch who blew her own brains out anyways?!* Ignoring him I pressed forward, still following the screams. Suddenly the screaming stopped and when it did, I started running towards the end of the hallway. The screaming was coming from the room at the end of the hallway. *That bastard can't kill her, I need her alive. THAT WAS PART OF THE FUCKING DEAL!*\n\n\nI reached the end of the hallway and burst through the door. I had my full weight behind the push so thankfully the door was unlocked and slightly ajar already. The smell was the first thing I noticed... Burning flesh, sweat, and blood. The second was the girl in the room; she didn't look like she was breathing- she was dangling from chains fastened onto the wall by a pair of crude bolts. Greg was sitting in the only chair in the room looking like a nervous wreck and fiddling with a blowtorch.\n\n\n\"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?!\" I screamed at him.\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\n*He killed her. He killed her. You've failed. Just like you failed Jessica.*\n\n\nI got up into his face. I was furious. I was ready to shoot this fucker in his blood splattered face. Then, I guess he got what you call, lucky. I heard a moan from behind me, the girl was still alive. *If you call that being alive then we need to reevaluate your medical skills.* \n\nI turned to Greg,\u201d What you did to her was beyond what we agreed to. I specifically said no burning.\u201d\n\n\nGreg shrugged and said, \u201cShe\u2019ll live.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreg,\u201d I said,\u201d one more thing.\u201d\n\n\nHe turned to me, \u201cYe-\u201d\n\n\n**Crack**\n\n\nI punched the fucker in his jaw; he collapsed to the floor in a heap.\n\n\n*You should kill him while you have the chance.*\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for going behind my back with taking Princess.\u201d\n\n\nWith a sigh I turned around to get to work on the girl. One first degree burn, a few borderline second degree, her wrists had electrical burns, bruises, lacerations, you name it she had it. Being a Combat Medic before the outbreak has paid off so many times I\u2019ve lost count. I took off my backpack and grabbed the all medical supplies I had. First thing was a dose of painkiller, god knows she needed it. *God is dead.* I couldn\u2019t believe she has survived this long, Greg really did a number on her, but there were no obvious fractures, just a patchwork of minor injuries that compiled to one large mess. I checked her pulse, it was faint- exhaustion, starvation, and a beating all combined to take their toll, but it wasn\u2019t anything even close to permanent, I didn\u2019t think. Judging from the amount of blood on and around her, she would need a transfusion. I grabbed one of my last blood test kits from my pack and with a little prick(Heh) and a bit of waiting, I found out that we were compatible. Good, I\u2019ll set that up after I get her patched up. I decided that it would be best to keep her in the restraints that had not broken. I could not be too cautious with her. She\u2019d proved others wrong in underestimating her, and I would not.\n\n\nA few hours later she started to come to. I sure fucking hope she doesn't struggle, I\u2019d prefer that the blood transfusion needle stay where it was and that she didn\u2019t break the bag full of blood hanging up above her either. She started to pull on the chain still holding her arm, and in turn messing with the transfusion kit. I reached out to hold her arm still, and as soon as she felt my hand touch her arm she froze. I reached up with my free hand and started to brush her cheek, hopefully the soothing action would help calm her. I knelt down to her eye level making sure that she could see the crumpled heap that was Greg was still behind me, but, her eyes will still closed. I'm assuming as to keep the reality of her condition still a dream. I guess it was time to let her know that the reality she slipped from hours ago wasn\u2019t as bad as it seemed.\n\n\n\u201cHello, sweetheart.\u201d I said to her softly.\n\n\n\u201cOh God. Please.
